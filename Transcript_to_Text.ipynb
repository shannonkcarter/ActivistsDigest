       " ' Casar: I would like to echo the comments my colleagues ha ve made Clearly we need to invest in partnership with land lordz whose properties are getting older and see if we can rehabilitate them and keep affordable housing in the long term I knocked on every one of these 15 doors I remember my campaign told me not to because there were hardly any registered voters there But I registered teenager 18 year olds at this very building And its one of our most economically integrated places in the city and 52nd street is a big part of that I hope we hold the prope rty owners accountable and bring the funds not just from legal judgments but also from our own budgets and bonds to copt to keep this area integrated Its actually in one of our homestead preservation districts and as Mr King asks the question of where are we seeing this happening Its happening in this part of the city and we actually authorized some funding for rehabilitation at the timbers apartment just up the road off of Clayton lane So this is an area that is seeing that little deterioration On e of my first questions is whether or not we could do rehab there But our  you know Im not a structural engineer or a professional and the fire marshal is unfortunately and its deteriorated to the point where its dangerous and potentially deadly for the folks to live there I know some of my constituents in my area would like to stay But its our responsibility to make sure that people live in safe housing I appreciate the law departments significant amount of work on this issue How housing works and the co departments work I have been since I was really trying to focus as much of our code departments efforts on these sorts of dangerous situations because its unacceptable for us to have folks potentially get hurt in those dan gerous situations and its important for the code department and law departments to really hold folks accountable when they let the properties get to the level where folks are living in bad conditions And I think unfortunately this is not the last case li ke this well see across our city and in particular in my district So I appreciate this dias continued help in that regard Right across the street an apartment complex just within the last couple of years flipped it provides perspective to the work tha t we do And I appreciate the council and citys action to make sure that the cities arent homeless or living in dangerous conditions ',\n",
