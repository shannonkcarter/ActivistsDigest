These children are at risk mayor council They need this funding for actually appropriate needs immediate needs So this is an appropriate  appropriate funding for the Austin children for women and children Ill always support them You sa id number 18 right Number 18 has to do with increased mentoring is a no brainer Former teacher at ACC Austin independent school district And I taught also juniors in college But mentoring is very important to get the kids back on tra ck on education and the last item mayor And allow me to  Usa today good article about homeless veterans in Austin Texas Coming to Austin because he said he knows for a fact that there are more than 5000 homeless veterans in Austin Texas FYI I like to work with you and your office on that if it would be okay _ Thank you may you mayor pro tem and councilmembers Im David king Speaking on item 27 regarding the city manager search advisory task force I think its important task force Glad youre taking an initiative to make sure the community is involved i n the process I think youre suggesting that I believe this will happen The task force the membership reflecting the diversity of our community and I hope you will allow the task force to comply with the Texas open meetings laws and not allow lobbyists to be appointed to this important task force Thank you very much for listening to my comments _ They very quickly will do this Theyll take the consent agenda Well ask people if they did the full three minutes Andy young will get called when we have item 26 The items pulled now are 9 10 14 19 22 24 25 and 26 Is there a motion to approve the consent agenda Ms Houston makes that motion Is there a second Mr Casar any discussion _ Thank you members Matthew assistant attorney I wan t to approve a settlement amount of 250000 in the city of Austin lawsuit As discussed in executive session on April 4 this lawsuit is related to an automobile versus pedestrian incident that occurred on January 26 2016 As a result of the accident sh e suffered significant injuries In exchange for the settlement the city will obtain a full and final agreement that releases the city and city employees from claims that were or could have been asserted in the lawsuit The law department recommends that you approve this payment of the settlement amount pursuant to these terms Any questions _ Is there a motion to approve item 9 Councilmember Garza is our second in this Councilmember Renteria Any discussion Those in favor of the proposed settlement please raise your hand Those opposed Unanimous on the dias with Ms Poole off Thank you very much _ Mayor pro tem councilmembers I think its important that were doing this Im hopeful that this property you know doesnt end up being demolished and replaced with market rate housing What we have done and we have to do this we have to help these families But Im concerned that were going to end up facilitating the demolition of affordable housing Is there any way we ca n hold the property accountable for repairing this property and allowing the families to come back in Low income families other families to come back in and remain in the neighborhood Im just very concerned about this And I think this is really import ant that we use this as an opportunity to look down the road and see in other parts of our city where is this about to happen again Which of our other properties are like this where the property owners are not taking care of them Theyre becoming dilapid ated becoming unsafe Thats an excuse for go get some tenant relocation money and then clear out and were going to clear out for market rate housing They have a term for this in cities like Austin where this is occurring Its called r ecolonization Existing residents are pushed out and being recolonized by affluent high income families Im not criticizing those families I know thats part of the  part of the system part of the process that were trying to deal with I understand t hat But we have to find different ways to see this Otherwise diversity of color low income families from our central neighborhoods Then our only tool seems to be lets provide density bonus housing and we have families pushed out of single family hous ing that they could afford and their only alternative is to come back and live in an apartment a small apartment And they do well that way So Im concerned about this I appreciate this item I know we had to do this But we need to see where else is th is about to happen And figure out a way that we can hold those property owners accountable now to bring the properties into compliance and safe for the tenants Thank you very much _ Assistant city attorney The state law that requires us to fund the reloc ation does not authorize us to reimburse  seek reimbursement under that statute _ Its subject to two orders that have generated civil penalties and the city is authorized under state law to do a collection action to recover those funds _ Im not su re how we  when we traditionally take  to recover civil penalties if it would follow that process If the council wanted to direct those moneys we could address that at that time _ Not under th is particular action But its something we can look into to see if that money can go to the housing trust fund Well get back to you on that question _ The state law doesnt require that we recover the expenses Does the state law  it allows u s to this But doesnt provide  can you explain it a little more _ Texas property code requires the city to provide relocation advisory services and financial assistance for relocation when activities cause displacement koez enforcement activities ca use displacement _ Correct Does it specify the amount I had someone calling the office asking about the appropriateness of the amount not necessarily questioning th e need for relocation But I wanted to give you an opportunity to talk about that briefly _ State law does not set a minimum It sets a maximum of the federal benefits so we would not be able to exceed federal benefits but we do not have a minimum _ Is the 600000 is it  is it 40000 per unit or am I  Im sorry I dont have it in front of me Do you know _ The office of real estate Yes it was attached to it as backup The total amount was 40000 Estimated Perez den shl tenant _ Similar to the programs that we used on the flood buyouts Its th e same calculation that we do This one were using a 30 month calculation The estimated rental assistance payment is 2500 for the benefit of moving as well But the calculation the same as the buyouts where we find a comparable property subtract the subject property rent Multiply it by the payment The federal law has a statutory of 700000 Theres a resort where we can pay up and above to the maximum of what that calculation will be _ Its a  spend toget type of program They woul d be made eligible But if they found a property that they pay 450 500 There may be a small amount of that difference that we would be able to extend to them and for them to be able to claim _ Mayor Can I get c larification of those extensionse limb natded Or are they on the table to come back at 36 months and request an extension _ A matter that after 36 months we either go back for another request for an rfi for  from the banks or we come back to council and request an extension _ Good morning SHAWN Willett purchasing This was proposed as 36 months with the cost of each of the options included The contract would be awarded that way but it would be contingent on if we were to come back to the council and receive that additional approval for one of the options but the pricing would be award in this amount _ I think theyre self contained Because they were  they relate to what happens after  unlike the other  unlike 10 and the other changes were considerin g on 10 those all impact whats within the housing plan right now These other two are complementary and they have to do with what happens after and so I think theyre distinct enough that we can go forward with them I mean everybody thats speaking as i n favor of those two I think we should go ahead and do that That will reduce some of the potential for confusion later _ Mayor mayor pro tem and councilmembers Im an dei young and Im a resident of universal hills district I speaking on item 26 Quick voir dire my family came to Austin nearly 100 years ago when my great uncle was elected to the Texas legislature then attorney general eventually appointed chief justice of the supreme co urt of justice by governor pat Neff My family is so proud of Austin and as always been active here More importantly Im speaking to you as a former crime scene investigator to the Los Angeles police department scientific investigation division I have six service years there I processed over 6000 crime scenes and my unit responded to over 200 crime scenes every 24 hours That is only 15 of what the police officers actually responded to Im not comparing our wonderful city Austin to Los Angeles But Im here today to say please dont make the same mistakes they did Learn from their mistakes The population of metro Austin has grown to under 2 million people and were playing catchup with the infrastructure We also need to pay catchup with the poli ce department Were short handed with just over 1900 sworn police officers serving nearly 2 million people A growing k 2 epidemic with over 6000 incidents in the last five years approximately 300 this year alone and the fifth year runn ing one of the largest  one of the fastest growing cities in the nation we need to let the police department grow with the city As all of us APD wants to be a proactive part of the city not just reactive They will need more officers to do this So I m asking us to please allow them to hire more officers I know budgets and taxes But I have seen firsthand what not having enough police officers on the streets can do to a city and we do not want that to happen here in Austin Thank you for your time _ Thank you mayor council Im Travis Wesley Im a native austinite I live in district 5 Im also the president of class citizen led Austi n safety partnership On behalf of the class we fully support the resolution to bring the city manager to identify resources to combat the k 2 crisis The city council in the past has asked for several studies and those studies recommended to fill the pol ice department to fully staffed We support that Without filling these positions were opening ousts up to more crime downtown And then spilling out into our neighborhoods If we dont combat this issue going on right now I  I think its going to get worse and worse if they dont combat it now So thank you for your time I appreciate it And have a great afternoon _ Thank you Im not going to take that much time Thank you mayor mayor protell Im David Roche president of the greater Austin crime commission We support the wisdom with which youre attacking this problem We thank you We believe youre on the right track We do believe we need m ore officers Past the point to the fact that we need more officers on the street As we attack this problem downtown we hope that you wont be pulling officers from outside the neighboring areas and the suburbs I think if you do decide to hire more offi cers for this problem youre going to get closer to your 35 goal for your  for the mayors council on institutional racism Youre going to get closer to the 35 goal on commune the I policing that Dr Rich obrady spoke to We fully support what your e doing Thank you _ Im Gus Pena Served with the director of the irs the bailiff at criminal district courts I will tell you this much I s ee k2 incidents daily I use a bus because I cant drive right now to use my  my surgeries but eighth and lavaca is one of the most serious areas Our proposal was to move the Salvation Army and the arch to levande rks loop Unfortunate ly I have a dog that saved my life from a rattlesnake So I will say I understand about the animal pet shelter over there That would have been the best place because it had a clinic it had a theater it had lodging and everything So we missed out on a good opportunity to move these end the is over there to  not to push the people out there because theyre human beings and I love them But I will tell you this much k2 is an increase I talk to several officers over there And Ive identified several when I go to case manage at the Salvation Army veterans service It is on the increase This is an epidemic worse than alcoholism worse than any other vicious vicious drug or alcohol  or beverage that I have seen and it needs to be addressed holistic ally Not being addressed holistically its piece maehl We have to get rid of it Its over there Once you go over there mayor put on your blue jeans or whatever and go see what I have This the combat This is combat Combat to save the lives of peop le and I had one individual to get the bus on eighth and lavaca I had to dodge him He brought him around APD was there I appreciate APD We need more officers I spoke to the public safety commission also We need more officers Boots on the ground bu bba We dont need them in the offices We need them out there to patrol That will be great too I hope they dont get angry with me But we need people to do the holistic approach Its a serious issue An epidemic But we need more help out there for sa fety personnel for their community and for the people already using the k2 and theyre abusing it bigtime mayor I hope you listen to whats going on Im more than happy to walk with you over there and show you where its at A lot of my veterans are on k2 I send them to clinics and the va hospital Thank you for allowing me to ramble It is an epidemic We need more boots on the ground we need more police officers Theyre doing a great job Thank you _ Mayor I wanted to confirm I put messages on the message board and want to make sure those are indeed a part of what were moving now _ Yes sir Thank you Mr Mayor Mayor I hate to do this to yall I go back to mayor Bruce Todds administration They mention affordable housing My retort or re sponse to that is affordable for whom We had a vision back there in 1990 92 94 95 about affordability lack of affordability What is different for you or me or us Im not disrespecting you It is just a general statement But anyway what I would like to see is this is we have adults in committees whatever studying  this is a problem It has been going on since Bruce Todds administration Heres a suggestion Mr Mayor councilmembers yall speak to high school students High school students are very very informative very very smart Lets get input from high school students not only high school students and ACC students that need affordable housing and ge t the different definition of what affordability is and what the needs are I heard a comment made about preserving housing for senior citizens Well Mr Mayor councilmembers Im a senior citizen I dont see too much senior citizen housing out there O k Us older veterans are to the point where were losing a lot of veterans my age And the military really is a hardship on everybody It tasks you to the 110  I have the verbiage I better not use what we use in the Marine Corps It taxes you to do mor e than you can So your physical fitness is not as good as it was when you are younger We need affordable housing I recommend we address this issue even at the high school level I met principals that want to allow students to be made accommodation to sp eak to yall in front of the council but theyre not able to make it because of scholastic issues Send out fliers to the high schools Get their input also Because theyre going to need affordable housing also Not just us There is a lack of real tru eblue affordable houses You ask anyone in the street is that affordable 1200 a month apartment is not affordable Anyway I will keep it short I was looking through item 10 Got a good article success story about the veterans I wan t to thank you You have been at the forefront for helping homeless veterans get housing Lets be honest You know there is a lot more homeless veterans out there And this is a real good story coming out of item 10 Read it I appreciate the hard work y ou do Mr Mayor Your leadership is topnotch Thank you for working get the students available included in this _ Thank you ma yor councilmembers my name is David king Im speaking on item 10 24 25 Items 10 24 25 Regarding the strategic housing plan Im glad youre taking public input on it I hope you will allow the zoning and planning commission to take public input an d provide feedback to you before you formally adopt it as part of the imagine Austin comprehensive plan Regarding item 24 the implementation of the plan and indter disciplinary action team for the housing plan I think this is important item that needs t o be passed Im glad  this shows youre serious about taking the plan and working the plan and implementing the plan I think this is very important that this particular item be approved What I would suggest is that we include  that we include look b ack process to look back and see how effective our housing strategies have been Like the density bonus programs and what goals do we have For example is a goal of the density bonus program to provide a variety of affordable housing Im talking about de tached single family housing or primarily a goal for apartments affordable apartments We need to have a metric that gives us input information And we need a goal thats clear I think it is important that we have a goal that says we want to help low in come families be able to live in detached single family homes where they can own them And gain wealth through that process Thats important and strategic I think we need goals to see how many of those homes have we produced How many do we want to produce We should have that level of granularity It seems like were putting all our eggs in the basket of affordable apartments And Im concerned that what were doing with whats going on the redevelopment of our community that were los ing the single family detached housing that low income families have today and replacing them with apartments And I dont think thats equitable So I think we need some metrics that talk about  that gives us insights into the average amount of land occ upied by low and middle income families versus high income families The relative percentage of low income families that live in single family detached housing versus apartments And Ive told you before that theyre consistently the real estate industry shows that families of all income levels of all colors by 75 or higher prefer to live in single family detached housing if they could afford it I think our housing policy should be informed by that We is have metrics and goals that give us insights in to that And one other suggestion that I have is that we include the office of equity in item 25 and regarding the resolution of preserve affordable housing along the corridors That is important for the office of kweshgsitty to be  equity to be involved in that as well Both of those Thank you very much _ Thank you mayor Mayor pro tem councilmembers for the opportunity to speak My name is Brennan griffin Im a native austinite to borrow something Mr Hirsch used to say like most of us austinites I rent I think it is very important to put some real housing goals into imagine Austin I think the strategic housing plan is a very good start I wonder if the number is even high enough Just taking into account regular population growth not actually trying to move the needle on affordability as far as I can tell from the way they calculated the 135 total units So I think that we should be looking carefully at that number getting concrete goals on affordable housing and on market rate as well really is impor tant I heard some comments in the prior public testimony sort of about zoning capacity I wanted to just relate that zoning capacity does not equal what actually gets built So we need to be sure as we consider codenext that were not sort of capping the capacity at additional 135 units we will think about what we will actually build as a result of the code next process So that you for the opportunity to speak Appreciate your service _ Hello Im also a long time austinite An austinite who rents Im here to testify in favor of adding more units to the strategic housing plan 35000 is not nearly enough We need a plan that keeps things from getting worse but need a plan to make things better Austin is in a n affordability and traffic crisis We are losing and lost many long standing low income residents and even some middle class residents What were doing is not sustainable environmentally fiscal and not sustainable fiscally People should be able to cho ose their neighborhood and not have it chosen but their socioeconomic status Inclusion should be the number one priority when it comes to how much housing we allow to be built Dont fall for the fallacy that the housing shortage isnt th e cause of the crisis When people are bidding on one house that drives up the price When landlords know tenants dont have good options they can and do jack up rents Were losing loss of old affordable units to renovation prices are going up because you dont build housing in places people want to live If you want to preserve old apartment complexes you need new apartment complexes built in old places not just on top of where it is allowed now Allow near more housing to be sure were being inclusiv e Most of the satellite cities where people are forced to drive By predicting most of our growth will be outside of the city limits and planning for that and basing 135 units with that idea in mind were creating a self fulfilling policy that will creat e environmentally destructive sprawl By forcing people that want to live in the cities to live in the suburbs producing them to buy more car produce more CO2 emission and more traffic We should focus on making it easier for people to drive less often and drive shorter distances Not making it easier to drive long distances No one is saying single family housing should go away entirely We should allow more smaller houses on smaller lots If you live in central Austin you shouldnt limit who can limit in your neighborhood to people who can afford single family houses The solution needs to focus on inclusion Aiming to make things better not just keeping from things from getting worse We should not be welcoming people back into neighborhoods they wer e pushed out of _ Tovo : Im happy  if I understand councilmember Garzas point and we will add them in parenthetically _ Robert spiller Austin transportation department I suspect wha t you were reading was strategic corridors or activity districts That may be where the confusion is The terms corridor districts doesnt ring a bell _ We concur and one thing we put forward during the need it is assessment as to if our funding is applicable from a regulatory standpoint to help repair we would certainly want to do what we can And we do believe that that is absolutely a housing option and solution for many households _ So my suggestion is that the only place where Ive used priority is in the be it resolved And we could simply take it out because I think its defined by the context of the resolution itself which talks about the corridors which will now actually cite the corridor study areas that are already included in th e corridor housing preservation tool And it talks about the creation and preservation of affordable housing for corridors throughout Austin beginning with those that receive funding through the mobility bond If we take out priority I b elieve that eliminates the confusion about which ones are priority corridors _ It all started in 06 when I approached Mike Martinez about cell phone use He blew me off I waited five long years He ran for mayor so I decided that was the right opportunity for payback Standing here I said vote for Steve Adler David Todd I said do not vote for Mike Then I told Mike this is payback Previously the council had the bright idea to boycott Arizona because of their immigration stance I hope they enjoyed the APD lab scandal and becoming a prop 15 They had to work to sneak it in Now its y our turn Thousands of dollars have been spent on research by the Texas department of transportation Ive got the answers right here Truck drivers refuse to take the toll roads Since you were brainwashed by Casar yall are in that traffic wasting time indirectly losing years of your life You are literally going to have a shorter lifespan because of time lost and because of pollution This is the ultimate payback I may decide to give the answers to the get city council if they are not a bunch of trai tors You wouldnt believe the most common response It was really weird in fact and weird And I got it all on my CV Theyre almost obsolete I dont have to worry about someone stealing this but there is always payback Previously I warned the others to let Acevedo go after he wanted to leave He department even stay a decade I did my homework Shouldve seen all the negativity coming from California You may say she doesnt like art or Casar and they are hispanic Im on a higher level Im for my country You see Im playing chess while some of yall are still playing checkers I conducted a brief survey last night and asked police officers how they liked Brian They said they loved him Media has said officers are nicer now Tha t was not the case with art People read between the lines He was brought in because he spoke Spanish All the attention was on art He was too social trying to win a popularity contest Officers did not like that attention was on him not the entire pol ice department We need Brian Manley Make it happen when the city manager says so and it is up for a vote He needs to become the next police chief This is his stomping ground Ive still got time I guess Ill repeat some of my stuff Previously the co uncil had the bright idea to boycott Arizona because of their immigration stance Boy I hope they enjoyed the lab scandal and the killing of prop 15 We said vote yes for everything except prop 15 Vote no Thats how we did it _ Soy Carlos and here I am in Austin Texas April 13th 2017 where I have lived continuously here in Austin for almost six years to speak whats right  First and foremost gracias a dios for discernment document one on screen now  To legally defend myself against the city attorneys filed bogus pedestrian in roadway charge March 31st I requested police vehicle dashboard camera video recording Thats nonresponsive basic information Attorney general paxtons op en records ruling 2016 10001 says must be released per the public information act because previous determination may not be used to withhold it Document two now Howevermiss Renee Moore admin administrative supervisor APD central records tried gasligh ting me by saying and doing the exact opposite in her April 3 2017 letter to me Willfully withholding it by blatantly disobeying Texas law and paxtons ruling which she claimed to have relied upon in writing Therefore miss Moore is allegedly guilty of official misconduct by intentionally impairing the availability of requested public information per Texas code of criminal procedure 304 and Texas penal code 3710 Thats a state jail felony because that loss harms me by disadvantaging me at trial Cam era on me now Her abusive lying criminal psychopathic behavior is not acceptable in any public servant position especially one with so much power over our lives How many other austinites has she done this to Therefore there can be no public trust i n or support of APD employing miss Moore as custodian in charge of police records Thats bad for APD but ugly for Austin which city council cannot allow Therefore do addition by subtraction Fire public servant Renee Moore asap The e vidence is right in front of you right now And its on public record for this meeting Drain the swamp right here in Austin _ Good afternoon mayor and council Im Greg Guernsey with the planning and zoning department Ill go through the 2 oclock zoning items First items where hearings have been closed then proceeding with the ones where hearing s have been open The first item that I can offer for consent approval is item number 34 This is for consent approval in all three readings I want to note for councils information that just before the meeting Alice Glasco who is the agent for the owne r let meco holdings LLC David corks cox has presented me a private districted covenant that has been executed but not yet recorded that speaks to that the rental units on the property 5 of the units will be at 60 mfi for 40 years and 5 of the units for rental will be at 80 for 40 years This is a private covenant It was mentioned at the previous meeting If the ordinance is approved by council today they will execute it And theyll present a copy to the city for our file So I wanted to make sure youre aware of that Item number 35 this is for consent approval on second and third readings Item number 36 is the oaks Mayor I know you had speakers And action will take place after the dinner break as said earlier Item number 37 is for consent approval on first reading only _ 37 is consent for first reading only And item number 38 we have an applicant request for postponement in may 4th And thats item number 38 _ Thats correct And as I mentioned there was a private restrictive covenant The owners agreed to do certain affordable housing for a period of up to 40 years 5 at 60 and 5 at 60 I have an execu ted copy of that covenant that would not be recorded _ No councilmember There do es not appear to be any language to that effect in the private covenant Were not a party to this covenant either _ Good afternoon councilmember Mayor and councilmembers  Alice Glasgow representing the applicant At the second reading the applicant had indicated that they didnt want to be tied down to percentages Were still committed to looking at that As to which mix that will entail But its not written in the co venant _ Yeah the development will have one and two bedroom units Thats the intent It s not intended to be all just one bedroom units but as far as the percentages of whats going to be allocated to the affordable unit housing percentages we dont have that determined _ It does not There were two cases the council approved The first one that was acceptable to the applicant And last time council the applicant was not willing to volunteer that at this time And I think councilmember  the mayor asked councilmember Renteria about a motion and th at item was dropped at your second reading discussion _ And you have copies  Im Joyce Im a board member of the northwest Austin civic association and Im speaking on behalf of the board today _ Thank you Mayor and counc ilmembers thank thank you for the opportunity to speak to you about the Austin oaks case Id like to focus my comments today on one word  respect First thank you for the respect to our community respecting our right to speak and providing us time i n the afternoon as well as evening so we can handle or  our existing commitments We respect the hours you have spent on this We agree with councilmember Garza that its no longer necessary to repeat our concerns Thus I expect to be the only one who i s testifying today We also respect the right of those who oppose the PUD To have their say and we hope they will keep their comments brief too Its time to bring this case to a decision Second we thank John and Michael for their respect for the ne ighborhood agreeing to and participating and for the many hours of work since Our zoning committee brought forward dozens of issues questions and requests for changes to ensure that the wishes of the neighborhood were accommodated in the PUD Submis sion That input was received with respect and the items were resolved amicably Third we thank the city council AIDS who work closely with us on this case always with respect for the needs of neighbors Louisa partnered with us and we really appreciat e their help This year Kurt has also been an excellent partner to us Fourth we thank the staff from a wide range of city departments planning and zoning parks and recreation watershed protection neighborhood housing and others who met with us an swered our questions with respect and helped us get to a good PUD Ordinance one that protects our neighborhood interests and binds the current and future owners to building a development thats consistent with the Charette design Out of respect to our neighbors and noaca members last night we considered carefully the current state of the PUD Ordinance given the changes during second reading and we approve the following resolution Whereas on April 12th 2017 the northwest Austin civic association naca board of directors met and considered this for the Austin oaks property as amended on second reading whereas the application received lengthy debate resulting in the adoption of multiple changes which is resulted in a significa nt departure in the new property design from the original Charette which the in board previously resolved to support whereas these changes would have a negative effect on the quality benefits and compromised reached during the Charette process whereas these changes include but are not limited to the addition of a new building with 175 residential units removal of the hotel addition of parking garages loss of additional trees and additional height on mopac and other areas therefore be it resolved by the northwest Austin civic association noaca board of directors that the board voted to and does oppose the rezoning application c18 2014 029 as amended upon second reading by the Austin city council We ask that as much as possible in your final deli berations today that you respect the outcome of the Charette in the final version of the Austin oaks PUD Ordinance that you create Again thank you and may you have an early evening finish today _ Good afternoon council and mayor My name is Madeline Im with the northwest Austin neighbors group Is front and back so it would be twice as big if it was wasting trees  every letter that has been written by citizens in district 10 and district 7 who have opposed the PUD And while we have all been participants in the Charette process and we do respect everyones right to speak we also have our right to speak too And we have worked tirelessly to put together a valid petition It was invalidated today We put in more names again today Were at 1984 missing 16 for a valid petition because of an easement in the road at spicewood springs that coordinating the 1989 ruli ng of our attorney general calls that to be city property so its not calculated in the metric With that strip of land removed were at 22 which is a valid petition And we do reserve our right to pursue that later but we dont want to do that We im plore you to look at the citizens again twice that size if you consider each letter not front and back on that stack who have written in noacas membership voted 80 against this PUD While we respect the boards authority to vote for it we implore you to listen to the citizens of the city you represent and vote no on this PUD And I wont take any more of your time I thank you for your service I know youre in a hard spot and you have to listen to all of us come up here and we appreciate that And I hope yall have a great day And please vote no _ Thank you for your testimony I just want to clarify what I just heard was that noaca does not support what passed on second reading So they are not currently supporting what is in the ordinance So there is actually currently agreement among the neighbors not to support _ The PUD As it came out of second reading And I would just like to say to both speakers that one of the problems that we have with the PUD Process is the way that it creates a dynamic thats very negative to our communities And I look forward to working with all of the neighbors in district 10 to move beyond that and reform the PUD Process _ Ive got a powerpoint to load up Good afternoon My name is Jose Hernandez Im a resident of green trails subdivision one of the petition signers Ive been in Austin since 1971 when I graduated from Texa s AM university And Im a registered professional engineer Ive been working with txdot for 28 years retired from there Ive got my own consulting company I have 47 years of design construction and maintenance of streets and highways And even thou gh I have a powerpoint Ive got to tell you that the thing that hits me the most is the traffic the amount of traffic thats going to be put on our neighborhood streets Not on mopac or spicewood but our neighborhood streets Nothing ha s been done about that There are no mitigation activities for our neighborhood streets You know heart lane is a rollercoaster up and down They probably cut it with a bulldozer following the guy going down thats how it was done no engineering design no safety considerations nothing You can see it right here on these slides starting on the left that car is going down the hill disappears goes up And at the very top is green trails And in between is hidden hollow and stone cliff drive These peo ple have to get out of there every day come in and come out every day Here is the cars coming up to green trails subdivision Thats our entrance You come up there and you have to take your life into your own hands when you start turning left And now with four or five times more traffic this is going to be a real problem You can see how theyre going down north to spicewood springs road Thats an intersection you can see in the far part of the picture Its executive drive and the intersection of hea rt lane and spicewood springs road Theres a lot of kids that walk to school They ride their bikes Its a big deal over there The people in apartments they walk there And so what are we doing about all this stuff To me the first thing is safety Sa fety of not only the people in their cars but also the pedestrians and neighborhood people We have to focus on that And we have not done that We should have a traffic study to focus on what we can do to keep most of that traffic or make it safe on our neighborhood streets This is the intersection of spicewood springs road and heart If you can see theyre going to put a traffic light How can you put a traffic light with all these spaghettis coming in at different angles You cant do it Usually if you have a 90 degree angle its easier to put a traffic light You cant do it here Here is lets see if I can get this thing going Its supposed to be a video But    Go back Okay Thats at heart lane and thats going towards  _ Going to the left its going to 360 And to the right its going to mopac Did you see that left turn onto heart lane Now here these cars are coming right here going to mopac Now theres somebody trying to turn left Now youve got to wait until s omebody gives you a shot and then you have to worry about the people on heart going left in front of you So its kind of like crazy See Hes still waiting there So Im looking at exhibit a where it was supposed to fix this Theres no traffic ligh ts for a left turn to turn left from hart to spicewood springs road The traffic signals for hart going to the right and turning left you cant see them because theyre placed at a different angle You cant put them where they need to be because of the g eometrics of that intersection So basically  and I think I sent you an email Each one of you has one of these charts that I sent you Basically you know youve got these problems Youre going to have to buy more right of way redesign the intersecti on reconstruct it and then put the signal lights How much is it going to cost Nobody knows And by the way the last thing is this is coming out of our subdivision That building right there that you see that light colored building thats going to g o away Thats where the park is Is five stories and a parking garage thats seven levels Theres nothing you can do to hide that Thats facing our neighborhood So what have we got to do why do we have to have stuff like that Why can t we have less Anyway thank you so much Appreciate your time _ I just wanted to clarify well be taking off the notes after the dinner hour assuming were done with any prior business before then _ Council good afternoon I want to say for mayor pro tem and councilmember Houstons benefit David king and I enjoyed a very nice lunch today So the miracle on second street continues I would urge you to adopt the housing plan but not as an element or amendment of imagine Austin I dont think that the change in the posting from taking action to amend imagine Austin to makin g it an element of imagine Austin has addressed the problem on pages 223 and 224 And despite any legal opinions to the contrary its my view that you cannot simply ignore those pages or the procedure for amendment that is set forth in the m As far as the target number I think you need to do at least two things  one is to add the 48000 current deficit in affordable housing in income restricted housing that exists today If we pass a housing plan that doesnt try to solve the current affordable housing problem that seems to me to be improper As I said last week the planning commission voted 6 6 on a motion to raise the number by 48000 So you need to do what the planning commission almost did with respect to the target Also Id like you to consider Peter parks comment to me a couple of months ago in terms of affordability vis avis codenext and that was that you cannot again to impact price in any significant way until you create a significant oversupply of housing And thats your consultant speaking They didnt do that in Denver the last place that Peter got a code adopted And since that code has been in place the last seven years Denvers median price has risen 20 faster than ours has under our current code So I would ask that you seriously take into account those two numbers whatever they are 48000 plus whatever in addition to the 135 Thank you council _ Hello My name is Jay Im execut ive director of a nonprofit think tank called farm and city I live in district 7 in a traditional duplex I think from the 50s I have a masters in public policy from the lbj school and have worked for Texas nonprofits focused on regiona l growth and housing and transportation policy for the last decade My overall comment is to urge that the target 135000 number be seen as a lower bound and not an upper limit on the amount of houses we need in Austin over the next like 20 25 Some thin gs I want to share with you the official campo regional forecasts that are used to plan all of our transportation infrastructure say that we will add 2132080 people by 2040 to reach 4120000 people over 78966 more people every year on average The ci ty of Austins currently 44 of the region and to maintain that regional share we should add 34900 more people every year Or about 13960 houses However I know that the regional campo forecasts are highly problematic They use data from the Texas stat e demographer that the demographer recommends using for short range planning And they allocate a ridiculous amount of growth to hays and Williamson county An outcome should be achieved with current development patterns and car dependent transportation systems is a nightmare of transportation Cap cog on the other hand uses the data recommends be used for short range planning predicting 12 million less people in the region than campo does The flawed campo forecast impacts the allocation of transportat ion dollars across the region and the citizens of Austin are getting less than we deserve It impacts capital metros project connect process and means that we cannot optimize that project And txdots studies that claim endless traffic a re based on the flawed forecast So to whatever extent you push growth outside the city you are increasing regional vehicle miles traveled You are increased our carbon footprint and you are increasing traffic When you look at the memo the demographer s ent you youll see hes lobbying hard for continuing the sprawl pattern in the Austin region an odd thing for city staff to do However he seems to be using the cap cog data which is intended for long range planning not the campo data appropriate for short range planning His projections for city growth through 2025 contain a radical change in the citys growth patterns also _ I guess Ill finish the thought The city demographers numbers show that the rate of the change of growth in the city of Austin will radically decrease over the next five years something that I do not think is a realistic projection And the numbers that you have on housing are based on that So please consider something more like 190000 houses as a lower limi t on what we need in the city of Austin And that would only keep things the way they are _ Thank you mayor  examine mayor protem and members of the Austin city council Although Im involved in many things and I was serving as the co chair of the working group on real estate and housing of the mayors special task force on institutional racism and all of the things that we dealt with in that I want to speak as a private citizen based on my work in that because I want to recommend some additions to the strategic plan particularly if it is going to be an addendum to imagine Austin I concur with the previous two speakers that we probably do need to state a number of housing units that we know we are down and need to move up My understanding from the housing department right now that number is around 60000 and probably as we speak its going up because as we have more people moving in we have a larger need for affordable housing Now going to the report from the work group there were actually two major recommendations made And I think that we need to have language along these lines included in the strategic plan One is that the city of Austin intends to plans to or will create a specific fund a local fund And we gave a number of ways that that fund could be achieved to create housing not just affordable housing but to cr eate a comprehensive program to redress institutional racism in Austin real estate and housing Related to that is we call upon the city of Austin to recognize and redress the racial injustices that were caused at least in part by prior city policies and the on going systemic inequities that continue After all you know we are the large city in the United States with the highest economic and racial segregation Thats not something we want to be proud of Were considered Progressive We want to get past that And I know you all agree with that Now thinking about the specific things that Id like to add within that comprehensive program on page 23 of the report we talk about Portland They had a criteria for bringing former residents back to gentrified areas And we think that that would be a good place to start in looking at redressing racial injustice So thats item 221 under fair housing and the right to choose Under 231 under rental housing again following Portlands lead th ere is an application that Portland is working with the private developer to put into place right now that we think Austin should also look into doing And that would help both developers  yall making decisions and people trying to move into Austin  find affordable housing units so that apartments that have affordable housing whether they are ones that we are approving right now or ones in the past that those units be placed on this application so that a person coming into town can find out hey th eres something over here and thats fairly close to where Im going to be working And thats a fairly simple thing that we could do that would really help everybody Yall because you would have information to finally make some decisions on instead of h aving to look at the demographers information and sort of extrapolate from that You would know exactly where the units are And then we had made some suggestions for the right to stay And we think that one of the things thats really important is helpin g people who are long term residents of minority neighborhoods or formerly minority neighborhoods in Austin to help them with  former councilmember Raul was involved in a nonprofit that works with the valley neighborhood and has expanded a bit to offer a onetime only payment for property taxes that the person may have fallen behind in They dont just do this onetime thing they then train the people on how to predict how much they need to be saving each month to be able to keep up with their property tax es and help them find people who can help them protest tax increases And we recommend that that be expanded to help a lot more people than just one neighborhood And another thing that we think is very important  that I personally want t o recommend  is that we have the chief equity officer use the new equity lens thats being developed to look at housing projects specifically in currently or previously minority neighborhoods to try and help ensure that we dont continue to push poor peo ple of color completely outside the city Thank you _ May I ask a question Did the equity officer weigh in on the housing plan thats before us were they included in that discussion maybe on hcd _ Thank you so very much One of the things that we did include in our report is true stories of people who have had to leave And I hope you read those because they kind of give you the personal feel for what its like Thank you _ Good afternoon Im waiting for my powerpoint show to be pulled up My name is Evan gill Im here today as a private citizen I recently moved to district 5 Im happy to be in councilmember kitchens district So I wanted to take a look at the numbers set forth in the strategic housing plan And Im generally in favor of this plan Im glad that were putting some numbers to the problem so that we have you know a goal to shoot for But I want to take a look at how we achieve the needed number of hous ing units for each you know income range and whether you know we have the capacity and the funding to be able to do that by 2025 So I was messing around in excel this morning And I decided to calculate essentially taking a look at annual rent grow th between now and 2025 what the funding gap or what amount of subsidy would be required to subsidize the number of units for one full year So this is an annual figure And I will  after I walk you through this chart I will kind of exp lain my calculations in a little more detail But if were able to reverse market rate and rent increases by 2 a year  so this is annual rent growth of 2 then the funding gap in year 2025 would be about 128 million I shouldnt say funding gap but that would be the amount of subsidy required to house this number of people or to create this number of housing units If we go back to 10 annual rent growth which is about the rate of growth we saw between 2008 and 2014 then that figure jumps to 1335 billion annually And you know thats a very difficult number for us to achieve on an ongoing annual bases going forward from year 2025 So the way I calculated this is for each income bucket I calculated  and this is assuming that the current median rent is 1300  approximately 1300 as put forth in the plan So based on that number I compounded on an annual basis up to 2025 what rent would be And for example at the top this is assuming 2 rent growth which would drive market rate rents down to 1106 Assuming 10 annual rent growth and assuming people can spend up to a third of their income on rent _ So to summarize my findings basically unless we can build enough market rate housing units were not going to be able to stret ch our subsidized dollars far enough to close the housing gap and to provide enough units _ Council mayor city manager I am Paul Hilgers the CEO of the Austin board of realtors I served as the director of neighborhood housing and community development for ten years Ive been involved in housing issues for a long time Im here to congratulate you on the vision and leadership youre providing by setting out bold goals visions You have to know where you want to go if youre going to try to get there The only couple of things that I would highlight for you is that you do need to do what you did this morning and follow through on looking specifically at corridors and how you can create a diverse level of housing for diverse families along these corridors And I think that would be helpful The second thing is there is an existing gap that you need to incorporate into the total amount of housing that you want You might as well think big And you might as well go for creating a diversity of housing stock that would meet the needs of this city I would highlight for you that the Austin board of realtors is about 12000 strong Youre going to hear from some of our leadership after me The board of realtors does a very deliberate process for analyzing issues And included in that is our legislative management team We look at these very carefully We take on issues are balanced reasoned and diverse and take into consideration the needs of neighborhoods families and this city The major point I would ask the city council to conside r today is to please recognize and reach out not just to this interdepartmental group which the city needs to include and I congratulate you on that but you need to reach out to the other institutions in this city You need to ask the co unty cap metro ACC and aid to get involved in the fundamental element of creating housing opportunities You need to ask the private sector and the employers to figure out how they can use housing as an opportunity to do recruitment and retention of the ir employees because until we all as an institution  as institutions and citizens get involved in supporting this major goal which is going to require  Im not sure its as much money as we just heard about but its a lot of money and its going to r equire more than just the city of Austin I congratulate you on your leadership and going forward with this I congratulate the staff of the neighborhood housing and community development department and the leadership of the city and the city manager for b ringing this forward And we look forward to continuing to work to push through issues of codenext and issues of rewriting the land development code in a way that works positively and proactively with the private sector to achieve the public benefits that this city needs and wants to achieve And so we look forward to continuing to work And we urge your support of this plan Thank you _ Good afternoon mayor mayor pro tem councilme mbers My name is bill Morris I am a working real estate professional here in the city of Austin I am a past chair of the legislative management team at the board of realtors that Mr Hilgers just mentioned Im a director at the board of realtors This year I chaired a policy team which is focused on growth and development issues in particular codenext And so Im bring that context with me to the discussion this afternoon We support the goals of the strategic housing plan With attention to what code next says about how to incorporate changes we do encourage you to adopt this as an element of  codenext or imagine Austin and to incorporate it as a part of the plan I do ask you to make sure that as you do that you incorporate metrics into the plan On pages 223 and 224 that youve heard mentioned before in imagine Austin theres discussion of annual and five year performance monitoring And that is intended to driv e changes to the plan as time goes by I would add a note that we are skeptical about being able to achieve everything thats needed in 3 of the city Thats not an awful lot of land Ive not done the math to see how many square miles that is but it wil l be very dense in that area in my estimation More importantly I ask you to keep the end in mind Codenext is the reason were all here And actually what allows the strategic housing plan to get the visibility it is The truth is we need a lot more t han 135000 units Youve heard the 135000 will keep us even with where we are right now and thats assuming the population doesnt outrun that growth But were not going to be able to build and control the cost of every unit thats needed We need a fa cility that allows the market to participate in deciding what gets built and where and at what cost Id also ask you to take the large view of this This is not just about the city of Austin Obviously all of you were elected by constituents in the city  But our ineffective code and development permitting process right now is actively exporting low  and middle income workers and families to the suburbs With them we are driving housing supply housing affordability issues miles around Were pushing th e transportation requirements that are complicated enough just inside the city many miles away and complicating commutes for everyone involved Water other infrastructure requirements all are being pushed into the suburbs _ And you get the picture here The point is that the decisions youll make in the coming months are not affecting just the city of Austin Theyre affecting what central Texas looks like and lives like in the next 20 40 years in maybe a 40 mile radius or farther from the city of Austin We appreciate your help _ Hi Thanks for letting me come today Im speaking as a private citizen and scientist Im truly grateful the city of Austin ha s put emphasis on affordable housing at this time It is disappearing so rapidly I have issues with the plan which contains directives which align the concepts of the free market to solve the affordable housing problems rather than building a concrete ho using fund that could really work My first concern is that the imagine Austin plan is to be amended with this document before codenext is worked out I urge you not to do that And then theres specific points that Im going to bring up At least 75 of n ew housing units should be within a half mile of imagine Austin centers and corridors The way this concept was presented at the affordable housing workshop I attended was that there should be no single family housing within a quarter mile of any bus route  I clarified that it was route and not stop My neighborhood which was built as a working class housing neighborhood houses averaging 850 square feet has five houses not within that area  that boundary Another part of the document says maintain existing homes affordable to community members but the policies for implementation imply massive removal of existing housing stock to make room for these new units The areas targeted will be those with smaller units Now there is allowed th e development of smaller houses on smaller lots This is a great concept for city land or new subdivisions but Im concerned about what it will do to existing neighborhoods with the formation of micro lots Relaxed regulations on both internal and externa l accessory dwelling units ads If you are serious about ads being built for affordable housing limit their size and prevent them from being used as short term rentals Theres a big section on the relationship between parking requirements and affordabil ity assuming that if you remove the parking requirements all of a sudden therell be a whole lot of affordable housing not considering that the land prices will go way up and not considering that we have no fundamental sidewalk network in the city of A ustin The strategic housing plan closely embraces the tenets of new urbanism Lots reduce parking and access to transit Research has shown that this does not produce affordable housing Only a small percentage of people who make the median income can aff ord housing developments on these principles Published in 2016 data for 152 new urbanist projects were obtained And it was found that 23 out of 152 developments only 15 were affordable to someone making the area median income And were not talking a bout people on the low income scale _ The last thing Ill say quickly is that Seattle implemented removing parking ten years ago Theyre building more apartments than ever And they have the hi ghest increase in the whole nation at 97 a year Thank you _ Thank you mayor and council My name is Alan Ive operated a small business on bur net road since 1984 I got interested in the Austin strategic housing plan because of its impact on my business I know others who have businesses on activity corridors I endorse the concept of affordable housing but I do not believe this plan delivers i t On the screen is a map I made of what this plan will do to Austin I took a half a mile red border around each of the activity corridors This represents a 3500 square foot lot with six units Theres actually denser development than this Take a look a t the activity of the corridor analysis I did which is next This gives you a layout of all of the activity corridors their length and the location north south east or west This if filled out with one mile wide activity corridors would create 51 million new units And according to the demographer in Austin that would allow us to put in 1247 million residents in Austin Texas I believe thats a little more than what we need at this time Im fairly stunned at the speed of this process the lack of data in it the lack of imagine austin required analysis and the fact the city is prepared to develop density one mile wide down each activity corridor I didnt even plot the centers This is tilted to the landowner who builds on the property nothing for those who make Austin home Small businesses pay a staggering amount of taxes yet we have four weeks to read and digest this document Based on current Seattle analysis that Ms Mcarthur referred to it appears that lower parking requirements will actually run families out Let me say that as a businessman I would never ever take this dramatic a change on the way I operate especially to business cust omers that I have This is a big mistake in my estimation It will hurt business in a way I cant comprehend  who my new customers are going to be as the patchwork quilt of redevelopment explodes Who are they what do they want at what price wheres t he traffic capacity to bring my customers in where are my parking spaces where are the families and will the flooding hit my business As a businessman I constantly need to know the law Changes to imagine Austin should be addressed through the annual review on page 220 Zoning decisions should be guided by imagine Austin page 220 Continued protection and preservation of existing neighborhoods to avoid endangering the character of the neighborhoods continued protection and preservation of existing ne ighborhoods page 219 One second Council there is none of this in the above document Affordable housing is a laudable goal but this document does not deliver it You cant build cheaper housing on expensive land If you want this done right please do not approve this document _ Hello My name is Mary and I live in district 7 Im also a board member for Ora which advocates for an Austin for everyone  Im here to testify in support of this plan Ive been very impressed with the staff engagement I actually got a presentation from them back in December because they provided a draft and were able to engage the community which I very much appreciate And I see how that draft has been updated based on a lot of community feedback so I really appreciate all the staff time that has gone into this document There are a few areas Id like to call out as particularly good that I think get lost in all the shu ffle And they should be maintained in any plan that does pass So in particular the focus on household affordability where you incorporate transit costs into peoples actual ability to afford a home is really really important The analysis supporting re ductions in parking is particularly beneficial as it directly affects rent paid by our lowest income residents We need to focus on housing people not cars especially as we talk about changes in autonomous vehicles and things like that And just because were removing parking minimums in certain areas doesnt mean that people wont continue to offer them to their residents and businesses Im especially in favor of the mention of allowing internal adus small lots which all provide more options to resid ents When I lived in Chicago where the standard lot size is 3000  about 3000 square feet I lived in a three flat home that the owner lived on the first floor another family lived on the floor above us and we had a shared back yard and it was wonde rful I could walk to the daycare to the bus to the transit stop the grocery store and I didnt need a car So it was way more affordable for me and it didnt have parking either So I also bicycle every day even now expecting at eig ht months I still take my children to school So Im encouraged to see that mention of connecting bicycle and sidewalk infrastructure to peoples housing choices So overall I support this plan And the only change I would add is to request that unit tar get be basically a lower threshold or to potentially even increase is because its a goal not a commitment And it doesnt account for many of the single persons who live with other people who have you know mentioned in various surveys that they would like to live alone if they could afford that But they currently cant And the growth numbers only look at current demand which were not even able to meet people at 100 mfi right now people who make median family income cannot afford a home in Austin So we need to address that And I thank you for your time today _ Good afternoon mayor mayor pro tem councilmembers I thank you forgiving me the opp ortunity to talk with you here today Im here in support of the strategic housing plan I will briefly talk about three things First as you all know the draft housing strategic plan is a two year process and it has involved a ten year community convers ation so we have had multiple opportunities for the community to chip in and give their feedback on this A plan that is From this process answers a lot of needs specified by the community and I think it is drastically better than what we have today which is nothing So having the plan and supporting it would be something we should do moving forward in keeping our affordability goals of the city Second I believe council should adopt the plan before we move to the codenext proce ss Codenext is a multi year projecten if you try to align that we will needlessly delay the plan which is not something we would potentially want As has been said the plan specifies our goals for the next ten years We need to specify the goals before w e move on to policy actions such as codenext to specify how will we act on those goals So we would want to support the plan before we go to the next process I just want to touch on this Theres been a lot of conversations surrounding having our housing stock 75 of our housing stock within a half mile of urban centers I do not own a car do not know how to drive do not talk to my mother about it The way I look at housing is where the bus goes It is important and Im so glad its a big part of this p lan so I definitely support that element Overall I ask you to vote in favor of the Austin teenager housing and plan  strategic housing plan and hope you will be able to do it today Thank you for this opportunity _ Hello My name is sakar Thomas and I am here in favor of the Austin strategic housing plan What I would like to do today is talk to you and Im here with the Austin board of realtors past chairman currently a real estate broker in Austin Ive been listing and selling property for a long time I would like for you to do a quick exercise in math so dont get afraid its really easy Write the number 48000 write that number down 48000 And then divide that by 12 Its 4000 The 4800 0 represents the average price that a teacher gets paid every year So if you divide that by 12 you get 12000 Multiple that by 30 thats 1200 That is currently the principal interest taxes and insurance would be for a etch tooer which would be great if we had houses that she could afford If the teacher wanted to buy a house in Austin that house would have to cost between 140 to 160 thousand dollars Right now sitting where we are apartments that cost more than that If you look right behind u s at ali downtown 201 lavaca one two bedroom rents for 1789 I cant afford that I go further 421 west third street one two bedroom 1689 I cant afford that What am I going to do Im going to drive to Buda like my daughters geometry teacher does and drive in every day because I cant afford a house in Austin Please pass the strategic housing plan Thank you very much _ Zenobia Joseph My handout is coming around I actually am in opposition to part of the plan as relates specifically to transit corridors Transit corridors are mentioned three times in the plan The word Corridors mentioned 20 times As a previous speaker mentioned it appears you did not plan in collaborat ion with capital metro transportation authority Let me just give you an example There are two reasons why you have public transportation One is for ridership the over coverage When you focus on ridership you are thinking bike a business you pick the people you want to serve When you are focus on coverage you are thinking about the needs of the people What I want you to recognize is much of what capital metro does is not transparent Heres a specific example Austin community college there is actu ally a stop in cedar park For the past three years capital metro has not charged cedar park for that stop So 27000 was just absent from their funding stream I often wonder why they kept the northwest feeder bus because it cost 2123 a rider While cu tting the routes where transit is needed in northeast and northwest Austin The routes that Im specifically talking about are where you have affordable housing Route 383 lake line bus and the route 392 off breaker line One of the things thats problemat ic they think like a business Route 214 they will receive money as relates to taxes from Lago vista voters They will receive money from jonestown I have no idea how much jonestown will owe them My point is they are focused on white people who are spec ifically millennials and I gave you that information on March 22 2017 72 white women ages 25 to 35 who earn over 100000 While you are talking about affordable housing anchor doors you have to recognize that the people that they focu s on are not the people who need transit the most I gave you some specific examples and I gave those to councilmember Ora Houstons office on April 24th 2017 One of the things thats problematic is what you are voting on a is an abstract map Thats a 3 0000 foot view Its not on the screen its in front of me though You can remove the map Its meaningless These are the corridors but they dont mean anything to the people looking at this plan Yet this is what you are voting for You can remove it One of the other recommendations that I have is what another person mentioned is aid In large part you have to recognize what the students need what the district needs and what the community needs as a whole and not vote on a plan tha t was done in abstract Thank you so much _ Mayor mayor pro tem councilmembers my name is sunshine Mathen Austin housing coalition and advocates in the city of Austin working to coordinate our collective work I was here to speak in support of the plan and Im here again The strategic housing plan is a critical core document directly relevant to a city that belongs to us all of us not just those who live here now and those of us that will soon have the leave the city for the same reason To be clear this document is one of a very very few that directly addresses in needs of the most vulnerable Transportation and afford ability We passed the transportation bond and now here is the next step to address the crisis of affordability I have heard criticism that it is not a plan because it lays out 60 plus strategies or methods for addressing affordability It is a plan becau se fundamentally we need them all There is no silver bullet to our crisis If there were we wouldnt need this document frankly We were confronted bye the beauty and strength of our city and intense market pressures and a state not sympathetic to munici pal policies We got what we got and we need all the strategies and that plan doiled out and implemented if we are going to succeed There is no  though no document of such a comprehensive nature is ever perfect for everyone I urge members of council to adopt the plan and further to take concerted focused action on the significant number of next steps to actualize the goals Thank you _ Rebecca director It is a part of Q and a Its part of the responses to the questions that were asked at work session We would be happy to make more copies _ Mayor mayor pro tem city council members members I spoke last week but I wanted to reiterate a couple of points Executive director of housing works Austin Housing works is also a member of Austin housing coalition which sunshine just spoke about A nd I wanted to let you know that we started this process I think it was about a decade ago if Im not mistaken I went through my files and I pulled a memo that we put together for prior city council March 2011 where we urged the city to develop a clear strategy for housing for housing across the income spectrum for the city and we laid out what we wanted to see in terms of goals and strategies to reach those goals So we are really thrilled that this is coming before you now And I do want to remind folk s that we had 18 plus months of public input that we were happy to be part of the stakeholder process and we really  there were multiple revisions The initial draft that came before city council the housing community development committee we provided a significant amount of input into that initial draft and we really felt like staff was responsive to our concerns with housing works Austin housing coalition and a lot of our recommendations were incorporated into the final draft before you So I really encourage you to adopt the strategic housing plan that is before you and make an amendment to the imagine Austin comprehensive plan because I feel like this is a really important guiding document and will help us get us where we want to be as a city Than k you _ Thank you mayor Councilmembers Charles Cloutman vice chair of the Austin housing coalition as well as vye president for home repair with meals on wheels and more or central Texas sorry old school We applaud the strategic housing plan We applaud the housing department for listening to input making this  the changes they could make and I am totally in favor of the plan as it stands bef ore you today The advocacy for 600 homes to be repaired annually is an eight year battle weve been waging for preservation of homeowner occupied housing So we dont lose the mom and pops of Austin They will keep our neighborhoods secure and we keep our neighborhoods in balance I also as current share of the building and standards commission as a private citizen Im saying this as a disclaimer to the legal department I am not representing the board but monthly we are confronted with failed multi fami ly rental housing and the in ability to do anything about it We must have a goal to preserve our apartments that are decaying We have more than 10000 units that are on the verge of decay as we speak We must have a safety net we must have an action pla n This is the beginning of that Its not the end We have many different strokes to wage this battle The mayors approach to this has been very heartening that we can come up with a public private partnership that will actually help our safety net We m ust move forward with this We will always Bain the day ten years from now if we dont act today We must move now I thank you all for taking this up I thank you for starting this process and I ask that you fulfill that for the citizens of this city and for the poor and for those who cant afford it We really appreciate it Thank you all _ Certainly Staff has submitted a summary of staff recommended changes that include a number of changes that were based on planning commission input as well as a few corrections and also input that we heard over the last  over the last few weeks at various  at various meetings Do you need me to read through them Its the document thats labeled staff recommended changes April 10th proposed Austin strategic housing plan _ It does And then we provided a clarification I guess a document that was distributed today and it just pulls out there e xactly whats in the staff recommended changes It just shows how the staff recommended changes were responsive to the planning commission recommendations _ Thank you very much Ryan Robinson city demographer Mayor mayor pro tem city manager Im feeling kind of lonely philosophically out here I feel like Ive been made out to be a sprawl agent or sprawl merchant That was not my intent And you know hearing the people in this room who I really respect and not to call her out but Mandy Demayo I dont ever want to be on the arguing side of Mandy And housing is one of those complicated sort of unverses into itsel f But my basic intent is simply to point out that what were trying to do with this plan and its an admirable plan is reverse really big market forces I would love to see that happen I would love to see the city of Austin retake that market share In this case market share is population But Im just not sure that we have the tools I want to be a believer that we can create market rate housing that we can generate that in the right part of town But Im just not sure how we do that One reason why I dont understand that is Im not a housing person The part that I know a little bit about are big broad population trends And what were talking about is really stepping in and taking this fabulous city of ours and really moving it not just nudging it or taking advantage of opportunities where we see them but Im just worried that were fighting windmills That were going to put ourselves in a position thats overly aspirational To me the word Strategic I harrisonly immaterial please achievable go als If we set goals its a goal its really ambitious and that grates and we should have ambitious goals but we need to be cognizant of when we become pollyannaish and when were setting something within the realm I think there are things we can do My intent is to not under mine this plan I think its a great plan The team its a great team We have lots of smart people in this room I dont want to intercede with that process I want to come inen a say you guys are talking about m oving a mountain If thats what we want to do then lets get to it But thats going to be  I just want us to be fully cognizant The one quick followup the reason I fear overhe had asking units  overscheduling units somebody said it earlier you have to have a state of oversupply The market is probably not going to let that state of oversupply ever happen The development community at least on the multi family side they are so sensitive to occupancy That when citywide occupancy kicks down one point two points they throw the brakes on big time As long as were all sort of on board thats what were up against that was my intent of the memo And it hurts to be thought of as sort of someone who is promoting sprawl thats not what I want to do  I want to see this city be you know the extremely successful place that we are But our housing is expensive because we are successful We have been the most vibrant metropolitan economy in the country for six years running So its a cookie cutter Ou r city boundary is a cookie cutter you are putting on this expanding piece of dough  I dont know if that analogy works There are strategies we can do but I just want us to stay within the realm of whats achievable and yet be ambitious _ You know and maybe thats already outside the realm of my expertise and I want to be sensitive to that because if any expertise I have is focused on the demographics I just think that from 27 years working for the city and following these markets the devel opment community doesnt want to create an oversupply We had a big oversupply in the 80 Forsyth those of us here It took a long time to work through that That was good old fashioned speculative building Was it good bad It has wound up giving us clus ters of affordable housing We benefited from that oversupply but it took us 20 years to get that benefit I want to believe we can influence the market but you know thats where I just  you know especially in a strong property rights environment and especially in a state that relies on property tax I just think its going to be a hard needle to move It doesnt mean we shouldnt get out there and try sue that was the intent Also I want to say when one of you reaches out to staff thats our job is to respond So I feel like Im you know that I did that I responded but now you know I  it seems like I wish that this was an environment where we could share our professional opinions with a little bit more ease than what it seems like were able to do now _ My p rofessional opinion is that there really are no best practices In my opinion no city out there has figured this out Show me a vibrant city with a vibrant healthy economy that doesnt have really expensive housing I havent seen that Am erican city _ Part of that is my own fault I did work with them and its  my day to day is just so busy and frenetic I should have reached back out My manager Matt thats something weve kicked around Thats culpability on our side I dont want to say there was a low level collaboration because t hats on us I would like to see city departments do more expensive cross departmental work And I think we could always do that better _ Correct And I dont want to say its outside the realm of possible to move this needle I guess I just  to me when I thought about my response to the plan that was kind of big thing I wanted to point out is its assuming a sea c hange in market forces that I think are maybe outside what we can influence _ Thats where the math would take me and thats where I would say let s be more  this is where I want to call on people who know a whole lot more about this than I do my fear we would accelerate the move of our organic older stock Thats a discussion youve had Youve kicked that around in work session Theres some s pecific math to it So thats just my general concern And I think you guys are past where I am on that general concern because you guys have heard that before When I worry about unintended consequences when I think to me that is more than what the marke t would normally give us Again we can move that we can change that My fear is we would accelerate the removal of our precious older organic stock I could be wrong about that _ To the point my d irector Guernsey helped me with that Ten years is a goal maybe it takes us 15 years to get there and Im not suggesting we change that but remember you know mayor Wynns goal of 25000 people by 015 We knew we wouldnt make it but were on on way M aybe as a numbers guy I get a little caught up in do we really expect to have that in ten years and thats the intent of my memo I dont want to say its impossible but it would really be a sea change in our affecting regional market trends _ I had a huddle with the housing team and I think more so than I may have realized in my initial assessment they are also big believers in the preservation of the older stock But I would think maybe thats one of our hyper monitor points is that lets just be really really vigilant that we dont let that slip away So we roll that into some kind of monitoring aspect to the plan I dont know But that  been here since 1959 Thats one of my fears since were talking about how long weve been here _ I agree with that I did not mean to suggest we dont put a lot of time and making it too binary but if we do that only after we have done everything we can to preserve the organic older stock Not one or the other but maybe a little  you know but mo re attention to the preservation than new stock _ When I look around t he country for best practice I look at the countrys biggest city New York City has got incredible levels of income differential but it works And it works because you can get on transit and its the great leveling agent Ive got a kid in Brooklyn who works in Manhattan These three blocks from a subway line I think we can mitigate this notion of housing differential across metropolitan space but the only thing that really works is the ability to get that mobility as part of it Were certainly stepping our way with a mobility bond but its got to be outside the city I go back to this notion were just a cookie cutter in this ever expanding piece of dough I add that because to me that is the only thing at the end of the day that real ly solves it is recaps it regional transit because you cant really have everyone on the same point residentially _ I would agree with that And somebody mentioned campo and capcog Since Im up here Ill take the chance We have to bring those two entities to go Npos and cogs belong in the same organization Thats the north central Texas model and thats one thing keeping us from achieving more successful regional transportation outcomes _ Yes sir Good afternoon mayor and council My name is Tony Arnold project manager with parks and recreation department Were here today to offer information on the zilker metropolitan parks proposed Barton creek greenbelt After this presentation which will be short we would be asking to grant a variance to allow for a site exemption for impervious cover limits and control to allow us to build this Ada accessible restroom and other facilities in the critical water quality zone _ Yes maam Rosie truelove the applicant has asked the item be postponed to the may 4 council meeting _ Good afternoon mayor and council David cull gan with economic development As you recall we had information last week where we provided more information about potential agreement with Merck corporation Staff is here today although we have provided quite a few of your answers for some of the questions that were provided last week We can review any of the information or we can answer any additional questi ons you may have this week We have members from the community and for the company that is present for the company today as well _ A change after speaking with the company regarding your request to include language and the agreeme nt that would help to memorialize some of the community impact goals and what it is that the company described during their time with you and through the business information form that spoke to more of the community related projects in terms of public heal th as well as workforce development _ Were requiring a report on an annual basis The report is for city use to better understand the community and how it is engaging in this project _ The company is not able to incorporate that into their agreement They will be leasing space They will be looking to make agreements on the two locations But not having a central location yet they did not feel comfortable making that agreement _ I want to thank our staff as well as members of Merck for including the information that captures what we discussed in terms of the community partnership I think thiss very important I think that reporting t hat on an annual basis will help our community understand how those partnerships are working and so I appreciate the staff putting that into our agreement Thank you _ Gus Pena native austinite east fifth street Our former neighborhood is full of apartments I want to make a note that land and engineer has retired already told me its still contaminated So when we do thing when we approve things make sure the land usage is clean not contaminated I wanted to say about M erck and I went a little bit off tangent If this passes and the reason I will support it in part is because what will it bring to the city of Austin What will it bring to the coffers What will it bring to an environment that really is no t vibrant for the poor the have notes job economic development thats important to me to the community I may not be here next week Im an old  Im a Marine Corps veteran If I leave I will  Ive been here 64  65 years now And I just want for the kids to have the best opportunity they could have and a vibrant community a environment that is clean for them When I was growing up And something economically safe for my children My grand kids my nieces and nephews My baby Sophie 2 12 month s old I want something good for her You met my baby Sophie I brought her over here anointed in front of the council I think of that councilmember Garza because you have a new child also and children and for my baby Sophie I want the best for her A nd I know my friends will disagree with me and they wont be supportive of me I hope they will But I hope this is a good economic development Im going to support it I  I trust Mike Rawlings Ive known him for many years Hes never told me a lie E xcept that I lost a lot of weight No man Im still heavy But I want to let yall know I thought about it and I struggled Were going to support it I know some of my friends that know But lets get the best bang for the buck buck fo r the bang whatever it is You know And let it be a benefit for Austin Im leaving it at that You vote whatever you want to vote your conscious Yall are intelligent Mr Casar is more intelligence than I am Do it for the best interest for the city o f Austin and Im going to look back through the housing We need more housing if were going bring more company employees Thank you very much _ My name is Chri stopher Rios Ive been a long time resident in Austin Texas Pleasure to speak with you all Speaking here on what have of the greater Austin hispanic chamber of commerce Im chair elected of the hispanic chamber We fully endorse this proposal to bring an institution and company as prestigious as Merck to our Austin family and community We believe in the creation of the Dell medical school in 2012 Travis county voters approved funding to bring innovative game changers to this community Its good for economic development its good for opportunities for our youth A sizable amount of these jobs will be available to individuals with two year college degrees This is great opportunity for the youth and the ACC campuses with that I fully hope that the co uncil supports this to ensure that we are bringing and attracting positive game changers to innovate in our health care delivery Because a healthy delivery is a prosperous community And with that I will log the rest of my time Thank you very much _ Mayor Im Bob Bowen temple shalom and a board member of capital idea The position of Austin interface with re gards to taxing incentives is clear Its working out the details of the citys economic incentive policy several years ago The position is consistent If any company wants to locate and relocate in Austin seeks incentive they must comply in certain requ irements Among the living wages is defined by agreement of regular and contract employees and the web compliance and insurance benefits for all of the employees safety training workmans compensation insurance Thats all covered We are disappointed th at the local hiring goals for Merck employees are not a part of the application We recognize though that Austin needs a greater supply of skilled technical workers Capital idea has successfully increased the supply of skilled technical workers but man y more are needed to meet local demand We encourage Merck to work with capital idea to ensure an adequate supply of trained employees to meet the community needs Beyond the formal commitment to full time jobs contained in the 3 a agreement and the other investments committed Merck has indicated to me they need to contract for many additional jobs And hear from the rules for contracted employees The contractedobs range from service to administrative construction and technical Austin wil l appreciate the opportunity to work with Merck to make sure the jobs are locally and represent the diversity of Austin On behalf of Austin interfaith and the 36 member institutions representing thousands of families in Austin we thank you for this oppor tunity to address the council Thank you _ Good afternoon council Thank you for the opportunity to be here Im bill rice Im the senior vice president of clinical innovation at St Davids health care the largest provider in centr al Texas Im the former chair and current board member for the cancer intervention and research institute of Texas which is the second largest cancer research funding organization in the United States All of the funding goes to Texas Im also a chair of a new organization called the Austin health care council which is an organization that is formed and intended to bring together siloed organizations and entities under a single platform to address community needs So I mention those three things because i n my professional life Im a physician by training I have the opportunity to think deeply about molecules and cells at the level of cancer Of organs and human beings in the systems of care in St Davids and underserved safety net and community as I thi nk about the things that I work on in the Austin health care council And coincidentally when I think about the most important things to accelerate progress at all three of the levels its digital health Its the opportunity to computati onally model different entities different organ systems whatnot Its the opportunity to use computational modelling to create the predictors of adverse outcomes and its in the  its the opportunity to use computational modelling and digital health to provide better care across the spectrum So I wanted to say that I support the motion before you because we think that the fastest way to celebrate progress in clinical medicine and all three of the levels the most  the fastest way to impact care and t hose who have the most need those that are part of the safety net certainly those with chronic disease through care systems community health and certainly cancer all of those are most accelerated the progress knows are most accelerated with digital he alth and computational modelling So we encourage you to support the motion before you on the basis of that I guess I finish with you know theres a certain harmony with the digital health initiative with the technology community in Austin You know tha t certainly the ai space here in Austin is emerging hot spot and you know all of these things you talked about are directly or indirectly to the ai Thank you for the opportunity to be here _ Dr Rice thank you Thank you for taking public testimony on this I wish I could come here cheerleading this deal the way everyone else seems to testify on it is But I dont think theres any way to describe this deal as anything short of disgraceful Let me give you one number that sums up everything you need to know about this deal 171 billion That is Mercks current market cap As a point of comparison I looked it up this morning Thats the equivalent of the gdp of New Zealand This is who were going to give a tax break to Now the innov ation zone at the Dell medical school sounds like a lovely idea and I think that good things can come of it But I also think that when the market cap of 171 billion Merck can pay for it themselves Think about the homeowners think about the person tryi ng to start a business in their  in their living room Think about the person selling stuff on E tsy why should that person barely making ends meet have to subsidize the development thats going to happen either way with a company thats going to make  that is currently worth 171 billion I dont see any  now you say this is going to create jobs You say its good for innovation These figures when ever these deals come up always get bantied about and they never come back nearly what they claim t heyre going to be So I can count votes I think I know the way this is going But at the same time I dont think this is a good use of public resources And if we are going to go ahead and pass this deal I really dont want to hear anyone on this counc il ever again complain that we may be looking at a budget cut for something in the future So thank you for taking your time for listening to me Thats what I have to say _ I want to add my voice to those who have spoken f or this They agreed on something Just hope they do for this one _ Thank you honorable council people Its an organization I represent Im executive director We provide science technology engineering science and math programs for girls Some of you may be aware of our work If so Im grateful We were founded nearly 20 years ago in Austin Since that time weve developed nationally recognized out of school pr ograms such as girls start after school and summer camp for the year round programs for girls The chief commitment is to provide support and preserve girls in central Texas but you may wish to be aware were reply kalting across Texas and nationally Wer e able to sustain and scale our work because people view what we do as central to their interest and nurture and diverse and rich work voice Were grateful for a dedicated group of individuals foundations and government entities like nasa its corporat ions who understand the role the most Its companies like Merck that place diversity among the core values that particularly exciting for us at girl start 100 of girls are underserved in STEM 80 plus of girl start after schoolgirls come from a nonw hite or low socioeconomic house hold And for us hearing the core value diversity Merck has clearly made is very exciting for us STEM Careers provide a huge opportunity not just for girls but for girls and future families since 60 of US House holds have a woman as sole or co breadwinner We have the opportunity to meet with the associate vice president and mark Sylvester of Merck recently And we were very excited Its evident to us that they have a strong commitment to the same goals that we share  I think its worth noting that they have an ambitious yet achievable set of goals for diversity Seeking to have 50 of your STEM Workforce be female is really notable What weve also noticed from our own research is thats achievable with regard to Merck with their innovation hubs and workforce generally they have accomplished a great deal of d iversity particularly with regard to women not just in marketing hr or but in true STEM Jobs Were excited because if Merck will come to Austin girl start girls will have a great option when considering what to study and where to work and perceive Austin as a place to stay rather than leave after secondary or college We know girls have great ideas and helping people is a huge inspiration to many of them Biotech innovative health advancements fit squarely in that area We know there are many reas ons why Merck opening an innovation hub in the here and now with regard to the support that you heard for the medical community the medical school and health generally But we know a company like Merck in Austin will open doors as well as open futures S o we at girlstart encourage you to do what you can to bring this national important leader to Austin Thank you _ Im not sure this is a question for Mr Culligan or the company Since weve been discussing Merck and the company name became public a lot of people approached me about how to get involved getting forward as nonprofit partners or as con tractors or as applicants Im just wondering if someone could let people know who to contact if theyre interested in being involved should we proceed with a positive vote and they decide to come here _ Ive been told that person is in t he room today Amy herrick is actually the lead for hr for technical recruits out of Merck So if they do choose to be here should it be the representative that would look to connect the individuals to _ I dont recall taking that second vote Two questions  first one  there they are The second item about family friendly housing about the very end of the change paragraph it adds the phrase support under the old schools My concern with adding that phrase one is the crossing of the streams between the citys jobs and t he school districts job But also this would necessarily put housing in one part of it And we are trying to get housing in all parts of town that would mean put housing where schools are either at a level of enrollment or a high level of enrollment So my concern with this phrase is that it necessarily directs staff or directs this plan to housing in only certain parts of town And I think the reason those schools are underenrolled is not about the amount of family friendly housing that surrounds thos e schools So its half policy and half question _ Youre looking at the planning commission Does it say Is this the planning commission So it would be  _ Its that reco mmendation  so that was a recommendation that was added Basically in response to a planning commission a planning commission recommendation and the general idea was to  was to help provide more family friendly housing near enrolled schools But you ar e correct in your assessment _ Right so if we include in the housing plan th at we should be building family friendly housing and targeting areas around enrolled schools my first concern is that it creates a situation where we are trying to plan around the school districts plan _ And we dont have a voice in their facile the is plan So its one job and the other job But more importantly I dont think the lack or the presence of family friendly housing in underenrolled schools is the reason theyre underenrolled nor will the construction of that housing solv e the enrollment concerns I dont think the housing is why the schools are losing kids _ Im fine with moving on The fact that this says This could provide is sufficiently less prescriptive But I did want to daylight that more so for that And then Im going to take a pause to make sure that my notes are in conflict or not in conflict _ And for me its as much about discouraging housing in areas that have schools that are at capacity which is nearly every school in my district But I still need to do  my district still needs to do its part in building housing So I think that the recommendation that we should be doing to help with underenrollment also wor ks the other direction that we would not build that housing in areas that dont have  Im willing to move on My other note is on  its two sections that seem in conflict And I want to clarify On page 16 change And I think they alter one of the ame ndments which solves the conflict but I wanted staff to solve the conflict Page 16 25 of new income and restrictive housing should be in high income areas Page 22 to 24 says 25 to moderate to high areas So Im curious if opportunity area high and m oderate is a defined thin thats on a map somewhere or is it just a description _ It is something thats on a map thats often used locally thats called an opportunity map and it does have different  it does define areas of moderate  moderately hig h opportunity high opportunity mismatch that you state was a staffing error So I think that they should match But those are maps that actually should be updated and we are looking at potentially updating those or creating some newer opportunity maps bas ed on metrics that are important in our community _ Well we discussed both which is obviously why they dont match But were comfortable with high opportunity _ I want to clarify thats councilmember Pooles amendment that youre referencing that I think councilmember tovo may be making the motions for _ I wanted to clarify something though I heard the staff say you are comfortable with it Do you recommend that or do you recommend  which  sometimes I hear folks say theyre comfortable but that may not be the recommendation _ We would like them to match and align We are recommending moderate and high Correct One of the things that this is  this is an important point One of the things that we want to stress is that when were looking at where housing should be placed we are also looking at areas where we could see gentrification The policy would be to add that metric to look at that _ So that criteria is one of the criteria that we use for scoring in our rental hous ing program And do we want to probably get a printout of that map to show exactly how limiting it is when you go from moderate and high to just high we understand that the purpose of the planning commission motion was to ensure that  that actually havi ng the goal near transit did not rule out also having a place where there wasnt as good a transit access So if  if council is willing we can probably have somebody pull up that map And we could come back to that specific question _ I would like to confer with staff for a couple of minutes on that so we can move forward and come back with an aligned recommendation so Im taking all of the factors in to consideration What I will say is it has been brought forwar d over time that the moderate opportunity area is one that we need to very strategically look at because of the potential gentrification issues So _ I believe council Nebraska kitchen and I are moving forward Councilmember Poole drafted amendments and is unable  shes not here today shes out on city business That is one  I think Ill leave that one for now and wait for the staff to come back Well pick it up in a bit Maybe I could take up my other one which is maybe  _ Its not one that we can report I think whats been presented to us is comparable to the other plans that we have adopted that are part of the imagine Austin And I dont want to change the name precisely because I dont want to change the impression that it s a plan Because I believe it is a plan I believe it is one that its important to start working on So  _ I move to amend the strategic plan under the maximize affordable housing to additional language The city should consider developing a strategy to purchase state owned lands as they come up for sale for desirable and aff ordable locations that include income and strict housing and parkland _ Yes I move to change under the better land for affordable housing adding additional language the city should continue to offer density bonuses as well as reduced parking and lot and setback requirements for the development that includes the significant number of units required to be low and middle income housing for a minimum of 40 years Tovo and kersee had additional percentage Correct me councilwoman tovo you agreed that number was preferable _ Just the question about the definition of Significant We have programs that some might interpret significant to mean 50 And theres no progr am that gets you 50 So thats my hesitation with  with saying significant or even significant percentage because I dont know how that word is defined And it took  have staff question _ So the citys current vertical mixed use density bonus prog ram which I say one of the most effective has a requirement of 10 of the affordable care act mostly 60 _ For me thats my guiding principle as I go through the amendments Im comfortable with significant at this point Recognizing theres an implementation plan It could well be that the implementation plan has set specific goals or we go code next We could come back and add specificity to this document So at this point in giving an aspirational goal to staff to come up with the number significant which I would expect them to use that in the context of aspirational and achievable taking all of those things into account were looking for something here that would be significant Im fine with that language Mr Casar _ Ill be happy to jump in on councilmember pools for starters She did propose striking moderate and I know staff have conferred and it was my under standing that there was some support for that striking but if we would just provide some clarification on that _ So we did take another look at the map and based on that we would feel more comfortable with having both of those actually be moderate a nd high opportunities to make sure that we are able to captu areas that are either you know gentrifying or are great opportunities where our low income housing tax credits can be leveraged and those are very  the qualified application program for those are very specific and so occasionally it will be important for the city to have flexibility to be able to leverage those funds _ That ha T is a concern That there would be areas that would fall outside the high opportunity areas _ I just want to ask did I want to add a little bit more comment to this because where we see the metrics and the current methodology is really where that moderatehigh can move I would just like to say publi cly part of the implementation plan which is actually pretty helpful is that we will be looking at a pretty robust stakeholder process in which we get a modernized metric system around this which currently right now for example does not include metri cs that foresee or forecast gentrification in this map So where we see movement is around metrics for example around education food you know health metrics Those kinds of things And so for us right now where the mapping is we know it needs to be updated and I think that that is a conversation were got want to have with not just the council committee but with you all certainly in the future but providing some flexibility around moderate and high would be helpful right now for the as operational  more visionary document And an implementation if this is something that council would like us to come back and tee up and bring more data around I think thats something that were going to be doing anyway _ We can take this up We could certainly provide some data that we fee l comfortable you all would have something to inform the decision further _ Yes So this was  this was actually an amendment that planning commission recommended was to have a unit mix goal and so it was based on the table on page  Ill find the page in a minute but basically there was a forecast of the number of un its needed in each  in each unit type and it was projected out to 20 2040 We did analysis to break that down to a ten year goal about broke down the housing types and which ones fit into generally this taking range between small singl efamily up to eight plex This is very rough but estimated it would be approximately 30 of the expected demand over the next 30 years _ We feel comfortable with the second part of the amendment We dont really have  we have not researched the  whats being  we dont have enough research to know whether we would support the first part So I guess  therefore were not comfortable supporting the first bullet because we dont feel like we have enough information _ Im assistant city attorney Outside of zoning Im not sure when it talks about exploring options what options they would be exploring All I can say is as they explore those options we would be involved with them to make sure anything that came forward as an action would in fact be within our authority to do it _ Sure I think that  I think what we can say is language around per industry standards and you know  and planning research I believe that youre correct that would definitely be I think what we would want to point to and what likely councilmembe r pool would point to and we would certainly cite that So I think we could definitely add language per  per you know research and industry standards we would set the goal _ Mayor Adler : See I would expect them as they develop it and explore to take into account that research without them having studied the research Im uncomfortable picking out a study It may very well be exactly right and I think that is whats driving councilme mber pool I just think its already incorporated in the work that our staff would do especially given fact that theyre asked to create age diverse neighborhoods So I think the criteria is inherent in the sentence that councilmember pool wrote Councilm ember alter _ She did And we just havent had a chance to look at those studies so I mean I believe that they exist but we havent looked at them and wed like to take a look I think the other question is how do you define Neighborhood so that would be something for an implementation plan to try and figure out how one might do that _ I dont believe we recommend decoupling in the plan anywhere though it has been discussed in different places _ In the university neighborhood overlay parking is decoupled as part of rent And so Ive personally experienced that with my daughter where she paid for her own parking and I paid for her rent for a year _ I would recommend that we stay with councilmember pools amendment and the reason for that is we have pulled the data in high and moderate Currently we are at 25 So with that we would recommend the goal be high and recognizing that implementing the plan we will be bringing back to you all more information on the opportunity mapping _ In the morning light all those new things you do coming into focus coming into focus in your head the sun across your face makes you look like a gold boy _ The belle soundscom Thats b elle soundsc om and connects to all the rest of the various social media that we are on _ They can  I dont know if its at Waterloo I should check on that They can g o to the website and order it online download it or order a physical copy Or come to one of our shows and get one there _ You should come on Saturday Were playing the Saxon purr right before ray Primm who you had not long ago Were doing a double bill we that would be great So we have a proclamation Be it whereas the city of Austin Texas is

councilmember Casar for your enduring support of survivors as we work to make the system more responsive and more justice for the two in five women and one in five men who are survivors of sexual assault I want to first of all  theres be en a lot of press lately about the backlog and as we work to do that I want survivors to know that if you have one of the kits and wants to know whats happening with your kit in a cold case you can call 512 974 5555 and someone from APD will be in touch with you about whats happening with your case We spend a lot of time on the start and rightfully so talking about whats wrong with the system and how to fix it but I want to take the opportunity to say what is right And here in Austin were very lucky to have very knowledgeable and passionate advocates and nurses who respond after a sexual assault and were blessed with a fantastic victim service counseling team at APD So I want to recognize them and the hard work that you do on behalf of survivors ev ery single day because as councilmember Casar said this is an issue that affects our community every single minute of every single day not just during the month of April So thank you so much and we look forward to working with you on future initiatives _ Good evening Im Delia Garza Im the city councilmember that represents district 2 which is southeast Austin Im often very proud  Im always very proud of all the work that we do here on council even the things that I may disagr ee with I know that my colleagues are working hard and doing their best to pass good policy Theres one item connected to this proclamation for autism month that I am particularly proud of because I was approached actually before I was even sworn in on my first term I was approached by a parent Jackie benestante and she told me how the city did not cover health coverage that was therapy that greatly helped children with autism and they said the city should be providing that for their employees So we me t with her and other members of the autism community and we were able to pass the policy that requires the city to cover those benefits So its special to me because it was one of my first acts as a councilmember and it really has helped so many of our Au stin  our city of Austin family So Im proud to read this proclamation be it known that whereas the autism society of Texas has provided meaningful assistance to thousands of individuals with autism for 27 years Ones of families  hundreds of familie s have received support in the form of advocacy recreation activities and support groups and whereas the autism society of Texas spreads awareness about autism Autism is the fastest growing developmental disability The incidence of autism has increased in recent years to an approximate occurrence of one in 68 births nearly twice as great as the 2004 great of 1 in 25 And almost one in 42 boys People in autism typically have severe difficulties with communication behavior and social relationships And whereas the autism society of Texas promotes autism acceptance and awareness of individuals with autism and their families year round and would like to highlight autism awareness in the month of April Now therefore I Delia Garza on beha lf of mayor Steve Adler of the city of Austin and the rest of the council do hereby proclaim April 2017 as autism awareness month  _ Thank you mayor In honor of move more in April month the American heart association wants to thank you and city council for this proclamation We know that regular physical activity and safe places to be active improve heart health and reduce cardiovascular risks and so were very appreciati ve of the opportunities for austinites to be healthy for good Thank you  _ Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking I just want to say thank you to the city to the city council to the city staff senior management of the city You know I came to Austin in 1970 to come to school here Fell in love with the ci ty right away Ive moved away and moved back a couple of times but Austins always been you know the shining light on the hill in my view of the world Its been an incredible opportunity to work for the city the last close to 17 years Mayor Im sure youre aware you have an incredible staff And I particularly want to call out the transportation department staff I think over the last eight years weve been able to build a team that you would have to look pretty hard to find a team that would exceed the abilities and the accomplishments of our staff So reluctantly you know when I came here I had a full head of hair  My dream was to you know grow it long and have a ponytail  Thats not going to happen it looks like La ughter So I think theres great things coming forward with the mobility bond to build a better Austin I will be involved as  with helping my friends to move things forward and again thank you for this opportunity and the opportunities Ive had over the last 16 years Rob spillar has been a great friend Robert Goode has been a great assistant city manager that has really helped us to see the vision and make it happen So thank you  _ Mayor on the last line if I could say that the city should continue to submit to fair housing laws _ Lastly allow the development of smaller houses on smaller lot S I have inserted the word Vacant I have inserted the word Maybe more likely to be affordable small lot renovations co uld be revised to be a little less descriptive and also open up just to really be clear that they are not always more affordable and then the last line adds and maybe we should take these up separately as well unless theres support just to add them to the resolution which would be great Such regulations should take care not to incentivize the demolition of existing housing stock and I would say this in many ways gets back to the discussion that we had earlier with our demographer where he talked about the unintended consequence some of which is we can adopt things This is my words not his but we can adopt certain provisions and code that actually intendcy vice the exdemolition of existing housing stock I dont think that should be our goal I think we should be careful of that We sho uld take care not to incentivize the demolition of existing housing stock _ On this one I actually  unlike the other ones where I clearly wasnt fighting too hard this one I created a substitut e amendment to that I think addresses many of mayor pro tems concerns But  and I think addresses mine as well and we can discuss it if I get a second Its on this Orange piece of paper _ The difference be tween my amendments and mayor pro tems are I removed the word Smaller vacant lots I think were not just talking about  I would not like to talk about smaller houses on smaller vacant lots I think theres the opportunity on homes that are going to be demolished for  on places where its formally commercial development or parking to have smaller homes on smaller amounts of space Second I have changed to say this would help produce more housing choices that are generally more likely to be more aff ordable than houses built on larger lots as opposed to may be more likely I think that its  its pretty clear that requiring a house to be on a larger lot has an overall negative affordability effect My  what my statement  the rea son I included the word generally is to get to your point that there are case of course where a small expensive house can be on a small expensive lot and you can have a cheap small house on a cheap big lot Those things do exist and I think that should b e acknowledged but I think that we dont want to unintentionally say that it might potentially be and we should research whether or not big lots in expensive areas of land will be more expensive than smaller pieces of land I think its generally true th at a smaller piece of land compared to a bigger piece of land is going to be less expensive I think thats just the case and I dont know of anybody arguing on the city staff or on the dais that mandating a larger lot is going to be cheaper And finally t he last considerable difference instead of saying such regulation should take care not to incentivize the demolition of such housing stock I change that to such demolition should incentivize more housing choices rather than viewer I think the point of thi s were trying to create affordable choices and more affordable housing across the range of incomes Were not committed to not doing anything that might result in a demolition loss theres going to be demolition and I think our goal is to preserve affor dable housing stock _ I dont think anybody is disagreeing with that Im certainly not disagreeing with that I just simply think that inserting Vacant is too narrow while it is true smaller houses on smaller lots do not necessarily equal affordability they can sometimes depending on where they are and all of the other circumstance so Im not comfortable with inserting Vacant I do prefer your last sentence to councilman Casars so maybe we can take these separately _ I think there were three against It was alter mayor pro tem and Flannigan That takes us to the last changes we havent discussed Apparently is that what the change could be to generally Are generally more likely _ Same thing as we had before So in the next paragraph still under small lots could bibiing changed to generally Those in favor of generally please raise your hands Flannigan Those opposed it is alt er Houston and mayor pro tem Others voting aye that change is also made Pool off the dais Okay Now we have to vote on the mayor pro tems  _ I can promise that Okay Item 36 is case 340120 Austin oaks put for the property located at 3429 3435 3526 36 37 3724 and 3737 executive center drive Executive center drive and 3601 7719 this is a request to zone it pud This is third reading of the case Im not going to do the staff presenta tion I think you heard it a couple of times but I want to offer up amendments staff would recommend before we start getting into the the council amendments The petition was valid this morning at  I think it was 24 something percent This morning we had one signature taken off and a couple signatures added on and as of right now the petition is not valid at 1983 percent except a few moments ago I was handed a letter with a signature from a gentleman named Larry slater representing into properties L P hes responsible for 46 percent of the petition so taking his name off its 141 so the petition is not valid at this time I also have amendments staff would like to offer up _ Okay The first addresses the issue of the use of the first floor of the additional  or off the residential portions of the property Staff would like to see some requirement for commercial uses on that first floor and the ordinance as it currently states is rather vague as to what amount of commercial uses there would be So staff would like to offer up the following amendment that on part 5a to add a requirement for 2500 square feet of commercial use At least 2500 square feet of commercial use on the ground floor of multi family residential  and mu lti family residential above the ground floor so basically on the two buildings would require 2500 square feet of commercial space on each one and the applicant is in agreement with that amendment _ Sure The language would be  mixed use development is required on parcels 8 and 9 with 2500 square feet of commercial use on the ground floor and multi residential use on the ground floor _ So the applicant is asking us for additional height May I know which community benefits hes giving us in return _ I guess you have to ask the applicant on that Staff position is we feel for three feet of additional height does not get him an extra floor its just to accommodate technical requirement has to do with the height of the truck in the loading lock So this is rather just a requirement of the physical building _ I  Im a little surprised that this is coming up now when this has been known about for a very long time _ The other part has to do with the transportation issue and the council member pool when she was here last time offered an amendment to include even though its included in the restrictive covenant to include the trip c ap in the ordinance At the time the number being discussed was 19648 trips if you may remember I said we should call those unadjusted trips because I didnt want them to be able to double count adjusted and unadjusted and get a higher number Turns out we were mistaken Pre proposed language to say site planner for the property may not be approved or ush eyed If acumulative  or traffic that exsides 15562 adjusted trips per day A request to change the 15562 adjusted trips per day requires approval by council I like to add words before that new trips per day so what this is the traffic generated by the jemt is proposed to be us using rough numbers 16000 theres a 1000 adjustment for internal capture Theres 4000 trips on th e property a day The 19000 is the total in the tia However I would like to include adjusted in there so it is clear thats the number that should be used It is not adding more traffic just clarifying the tia memo and the final part has to do with parki ng and there was some discussion earlier about the parking proposed by the applicant There is an announce in this case for a reduction in the parking and urban core and the part that refers to the change in the parking we think should refer to parking req uirements and urban core reductions We add 2672a and its just a code reference issue doesnt change the numbers _ I had a question on the transportation Did I hear you say you were going to add some additional language to whats up on the screen I may not have heard you correct limit _ Yes I would like to say where it says 15000 adjusted trips per day I wou ld like it to stay 15562 new adjusted trips per day _ Theres a credit given for the 4000 trips that already exist on the site per day So the total trips stated to me 19000 that we stated last time The transportat ion department would like to refer to it as 15562 new trips and if you look at tia you see theres already 4000 trips in there already existing _ It is setting a cap The difference is theres already 4000 trips today The new development would add 15000 tr ips to that for a total of 19000 This is stating in the ordinance repeating what is in the restrictive cover fence saying theres 15000 new trips and I have transportation it info if you want to do that _ When you measure it after the development an d were determining what the cap is what your measurement at that time should be you are saying it should be 15562 plus the existing 4000 right _ Yes Throughout the tia we reference the adjusted trips or new trips throughout Part of our desires is to be consistent with that This gives applicant more leeway and allow that cap to increase It just maintains consistency throughout When the original of 1900 or so trips were discussed that came from the dais We might have read the wrong number It s 19000 and change close to 20000 Thats not changed but the number that were confident in and we used throughout the tia is the adjusted number at 15000 _ So last question then so for purposes of being able to evaluate what is happening on th e site are you saying its not necessary to actually put the total cap Because when you go out there are you going to have to measure and then back into it Because that number is not actually the cap _ Right But we know how many trips are being cr eated today So we can compare the news to what we see today Eric would you like to  _ To what you see today not at the time that you measure it right Im just thinking that it might be clear that if you use both term so its 150 00 adjusted not to exceed a total cap of the total amount I mean Im just concerned about what happens seven eight nine ten years from now There may be some confusion what the total cap may be Does that make sense what Im asking _ The reason we preferred the 15000 number like Mr Spiller said was all of the analysis all of the impacts to the network over the mitigation associated with the impacts are based on the 15000 number U _ I think what were trying to say shall not exceed 15562 n et new trips Were trying to meet the ambiguity You can look at these and say any of interpreted as adjusted numbers I think 15000 and changes are what were basing analysis on To us its really the benchmark of what the tia is based on _ Its not necessarily the compliance We can look at the  measure traffic in terms of taking counts There s some for example a signal is a signal warranted in the future We can take a look at counts measure them compare them against a series of warrants and see if its appropriate to signal wise Thats kind of a back check to see the true impacts to the network _ If I can add a little to that the way we enforce this is not necessarily after its built but prior to when its built We cap the trips at 15562 new 19645 total and as site plans came in we would add the traffic An office building would come in we say this is this many square feet We subtract that off the total Necessary building comes in et cetera Et cetera making sure the total development at the end of the day doesnt exceed it _ And just to reiterate council member assuming this dev elopment is built in pieces as new pieces are added you can certainly measure the trips at the driveway and compare that to the existing trips at the driveways and find what the difference is I think that allows as those new pieces come in for developme nt to have that discussion with developer where they are with with respect to the cap _ So for future reference can you tell us which is higher unadjusted or adjusted Because the concern is going to be to have the least amount of traffic possible and not be granting additional traffic than what we granted in the prior reading and since we got conflicting information can you go through how those terms play out in terms of which gives you more traffic _ Well in terms of unadjusted it starts wit h the if you will the raw rates or equations for the land use And then theres a series of adjustments that occur Might be a little hard to follow on the table but for example theres over 20000  theres a 5 percent internal capture reduction which means the relationship among the land uses You can take a reduction off the raw generation recognizing that somebody using one part of the site one land use does not necessarily generate another trip to use another one So that gets do wn to the 19000 and change Theres a credit for the 4086 trips generated by the existing office Once the math is done its net 15000 trips and change that the analysis is based on They are related to each other So essentially none adjusted would be the 20000 The adjusted  you could view as 19000 and change We look at it as 15000 ultimate reduced value that the analysis is based on _ But if we were to put a limit on 15562 unadjusted we would have less traffic than we would if why put in a cap of 5062 adjusted _ The adjusted trips are new trips created by the development They are already getting credit for the 4000 or so trips today So really what were doing because we can manage the new trips or we can regulate the new trips w hat they have today is what they have today the 4000 is sort of the starting point for this calculation _ I guess my question is that ultimately what my constituents care about is having the least amount of traffic and we passed it saying it was unad justed at one level and then we are saying that its supposed to be adjusted and my question is if the number 19000 or 15000 that we want to use for reference if its unadjusted does that imply less traffic than it being adjusted _ I do not believe  I think it gives  no I think they are essentially the same numbers even though physically one is 19 and one is 15 _ Im not asking about the  excuse me sorry to interrupt Im not asking about the number I understand where you got the 19 versu s the 15 That Im not arguing with My question if its adjusted versus unadjusted does that imply more or less traffic _ Going to one doesnt allow them to have any more trips than if we use the other For consistency we recommend you use the adjusted 15000 _ Thats what I was trying to clarify And then I had a question for Mr Rusthoven if nobody else has questions I want to confirm when you confirm the 2500 square feet there that is t he same  does that allow them to do more than just retail How do we interpret what could go there under that classification Sometimes youve heard of retail and sometimes its commercial I want to clarify what uses theyre allowing I am all for havi ng it be mixed use I want to clarify that _ Im trying to find the chart Here it is Right now it would be very limited The applicant would like to expand the possible number of commercial uses and I dont believe the staff woo be owes posed to his rewrist Right now the list is communication services which is utility thing food preparation food sales he parking lot of course for the uses religious assembly and restaurants So in real life that limits it pretty much to a restaurant The applica nt would like to add general retail sales convenience which is retail as we know it as well as personal services which are things like hair salons and fitness studio and such and would also like to add pet services which are things like pet stores or a vets office To increase the marketability if you will of that 2500 square foot space that you have on the first floor of the residential building So staff would not be opposed to those amendments but right now its pretty much limit ed to a restaurant The concern is if they couldnt find a restaurant they would have to leave the space vacant _ Correct If you like you could make an amendment to add general retail sales convenience  personal services and pet services to the list of permitted uses in exhibit D under uses permitted in the ao restaurant category If you like I could write language for that if thats the councils desire _ Im sorry I thought we were discussing th e restaurant tract But speaking to the residential tracts only their permitted uses that would be allowed there for the commercial Include a wide variety of commercial uses including admin and business office art gallery artworkshop Communication services financial services food sales general retail sales general  lets see Personal services pet services professional office and restaurant _ So just to clarify then for the retail thats being proposed under parcels 8 and 9 that would be part of the mixed use residential Thats the one that would have the more expansive recommendation Thats what you are recommending at this point _ The language today just said mixed use development is required in parcels 8 and 9 with commercial ground floor use and multi family use above the ground floor I was concerned that di d not define how much commercial there was _ So we have a base motion Is there a motion to approve what we had last week with the changes that staff laid out Is there a moti on Were looking for a motion My understanding is  Im going for a base motion Whats on the  whats the proposal on this _ The proposal on the table we have a potential third reading I think an appropriate motion would be take a motion on the third reading with amendmentes recommended by staff _ Michael Whalen on behalf of spire realty Im going to run through these qui ckly and address some motions I heard about I know theres a lot more time to discuss First I wanted to talk about what happened on second reading so everybody could physically  Im sorry  so everybody could see what we were talking about This was t he original preferred plan that was done It had  you can see the purple is the hotel Blue is office red is retail and then you have on parcel 9 the multi family with the park next to it So the supreme on second reading was to move th e five story 125 square foot office and retail to where the hotel is and eliminate the hotel so thats what happened kind of as the first move Then a new multi family building was added to parcel 8 and you can imagine it had ripple effects We had to rel ocate 125000 square feet of office that I just showed you That added 1000 square feet to parcel 6 We added 25000 square feet to building 3 so we would get back to even with 125000 square feet We would keep the parking height the same on 6 and 7 even though office retires more park sog we added parking garage above the restaurants There was a motion that passed to add a floor on parcel 9 Thats a building 100 yards away from homes Its over 390 feet awayrom single family home as cross hart lane and two floors of commercial were added on building 4 for community benefits and as we know that required the addition  or the addition after 25000 on building 3 and 40000 on building 2 Both of those are on parcel 3 required two level of parking to be added Well look at that in a moment What did I say Heres the updated plan Parcel 8 added No more commercial no more hotel We now have multi family red is retail facing the park and streets and as you move toward mopac you have the restaurant and r etail in red First thing you have as I said 100000 square feet of office and 25000 square feet on parcel 3 to get you to 125 We then kept that garage the same level but to accommodate the needed parking for the 100000 square foot of o ffice we added park on top of parcels 4 and 5 thats 53 feet then on the four story 175 unit apartment complex with ground floor retail it was added on second reading and an additional floor was added This is the one thats more than 390 feet away from the single family residence Thats what happened Two floors on the right were added up against mopac on building 4 and the parking garage had two levels added to accommodate the 65000 square feet of office that was added on that parcel Remember we too k away 125000 originally from parcel 8 so thats a lot But thats what happened on second reading And we can go back and review any and all of that of course _ I wanted to talk about minimum parking requirements There was a lot of discussion about t hat I had an opportunity to witness the work session and the first thing I really wanted to emphasize is people do not design to the minimum The minimum is  and the reason its  that people dont design to the minimum is the market wont tolerate th at and I think we saw that from the back up that people received and I thought I brought my copy here but there was the back up has as we know a parking analysis of lots and lots of class A office space and very few if any are anywhere near the mi nimum and the reason is parking in the city of Austin is a way to control density and what happens is if you limit somebodys parking levels you limit their ability to build office Thats just a fact and that is exactly what will happ en here if these levels are reduced and it will not work for a drawing we got this as tight as we can One thing thats important to note our number falls between the minimum number we selected and we had out there more than a year was a number between the minimum parking requirement outside the urban core and lower inmum requirement inside the minimum core We have a number thats right in the middle Not right in the middle And that you saw from the analysis that Mr Rusthoven shared with you at the work session One reason we did the parking garage We were encouraged by lots of neighborhood to build parking garages because it reduces impervious cover and gets cars off the street There are a lot of people that want more parking garages so people wou ld be off the street There has been confusion about this I own that thats my fault I had not been as clear about the minimum requirement and where its coming from We had our minimum requirement out there based on what we thought the market could bea r in terms of lowest possible minimum and thats what we roughly designed to when we have the levels of parking As I said it was  its been published for over a year and I think whats happened with this and I think weve seen it in todays society w hen somebody makes a mistake its elevated quite a bit and obviously social media and opportunities publicly or privately create an opportunity  a nice opportunity to pin somebody on a gotcha So the proposed put parking as I said the minimums are between the urban core minimum and standard core As you heard Mr Rusthoven He mentioned some garages I ask please mercy for someone to make a mess to allow to make sure each garages have the additional three feet The land planners not the architects the land planners that worked on the design and gave the original heights are here to explain what happened They are not architects they did not know about the beam so they have loading docks inside the garages and w ithout it well obviously not be able to have the loading dockses inside the garages T Is a gotcha in todays side and Im pleading a little mercy from folks frankly on that You saw already I think we got to develop older sites we end up hurting ourse lves It encourages sprawl its bad for the environment and hurts our tax base I know councilmember Flannigan had question with regard to that as well Less something did change We spent hours on housing and housing has become priority for this council and ultimately perhaps where we are L we found from your perspective were balancing the need for housing request for a neighborhood park Reasoningful housing occurs on d7 d10 and d9 and here will be actual containment on the creek removing impervi ous cover over two acres of impervious cover being removed Increased tax base rather than sprawl Tax mitigation which was leveraged up to 16 million Theres connectivity and of course affordable housing Again reminder moving from 66 which is 59  which is a reduction of more than 21 acres removing 16 acres of impervious cover in  were doing 20000 feet of cubic stormwater Laying back the unnamed creek and restoring the bank 15 million in park development dollars to be us ed on the remaining park and remaining money to be used on heritage park Were paying all of the money for the restoration of the creek and heritage trail et cetera et cetera And all of the money for the demolition Theres 44 percent more open space t han required on this site and ultimately which is a good thing theres  were preserving at least 75 percent of combined heritage and protective trees There are larger streetyard industries multi modal improvements and traffic cap less than maximum l egally allowed You already had a nice discussion about Mr Bollack and Mr Spiller on that As a reminder staff did recommend approval of the with about 700000 Were now at 16 million of traffic improvements More than two X of what was originally r ecommended for approval of zoning Finally affordable housing And I showed this data before District 10 has 1 percent of citywide units its the lowest amount of any district right now Austin oaks plan the current plan would inkreebs the number of i ncome restricted units by 25 percent from 175 to 220 And that translates neighborhood housings memo that translates to a community benefit of more that 128 million Thats meaningful and again maybe thats how we tie into  well its obviously ver y meaningful So environmental detention parkland open space affordable housing mixed use Its a nice mixed use A lot of people spent a lot of hours you spend an incredible amount of time of which were very grateful I hope when you talk about park ing levels Certain numbers for affordable units A minimum number you I hope you give me an opportunity how that impacts development because it will have an adverse effect Thank you very much _ Thank you Mayor mayor pro tem and council members my name is Karen Ceroni you heard from me before Last time I was here I told you about the machines that were put into our environ in a job that I was holding and how people were laid off because of those machines What I didnt say is more machines kept coming and more people kept losing their jobs And the reason I mention this is i f you approve the loss of this many heritage tree the more well ask and the more well come _ I want to remind you what the trees look like They are all individually painted This is Selina Pine top You notice part of the tree is black Thats bec ause this tree will be killed This is Patsy cline Buck Owens Buddy holly Marshal ball This one represents Stevie ray Vaughn This is Janis Joplin And this one Im going to let you try and guess but I know you dont know it so Im go ing to pass on it This is our lady yoga you might see by that foot there Thats why its called lady yoga This is Whalen Jennings This is ray price And the hardest one to do was Willie Nelson and I couldnt figure out why and I think I got it Willie Nelson looks horrible and I tried to make it look good because hes going to be saved and removed Which if you move the trees I ask that you move them to far west boulevard because the speed limit is 35 miles an hour and we are not allowed to landscap e it so oak trees would really be wonderful there The reason hes black inside is because all of the trees that he grew up with are going to be killed And so when I couldnt get him to literally look good I decided there was a reason And that was the reason There have been a lot of developments today that are kind of strange city land that is not an easement Its city land its what The city has had the petitions that we sent over three months and new things keep coming to light So the question i s why are we just now finding out about this strip of land We know that a couple of the people that signed the petition have been threatened Im not going to mention names because thats not fair to them because they have withdrawn And so you know right now we dont have a valid petition but a lot of things have changed today The presidents  had we had the valid petition when we did have it and everything kept being postponed we would be in a different place right now and prec edent has been sent that if theres a member away from the dais that in fact there is no vote and the council could actually opt to do that if they wanted to This week you also got information about salamandersalamanders The restoration of the quote creek needs to be carefully monitored because we know there are joelville salamanders underneath that ground and Im not hearing that mentioned and for the developer I would have to ask how much is enough How much profit is enough Theyve made more t han double the amount since the purchase of that property in 2013 As you know Custer had a last stand and this is Karens last stand I have been a community activist all of my adult life with the city of Austin since 1983 Ive seen many administration s Some of you know me from before We made lots of promises about things changing about how staff can approve things and Im just not seeing whats been promised all of these years And so one of the things that has come to light for me recently is in 2010 you may remember Hermine came through and did a lot of damage I tried to get the repairs done We didnt have the money I was told by Marty stump Sarah hensly on and on go to the bond hearings thats how you get money to do repa irs I went to the bond meetings I was the only citizen at these meetings I was able to get 75000 for bull creek park Bull creek park has a plan Not one thing that that money I asked for is being done Because the city staff says according to this this rule that whatever we can do this we do that So why did  why did I Im going to ask you to please vote now _ Thank you mayor mayor pro tem John ruff Royalty group Its been a long process You heard our story And know the changes I want to revisit the history a little bit We purchased Austin oaks in 2012 We did not purchase the property with the expre ss intent to redevelop Our business model as many suggested did not hinge on the success of a rezoning case Our profit that so many have been concerned with was not reliant on something which we did not have by right Instead like everything we do it was based on providing the market with the best possible product within the many limitations present Between 2012 and 2014 it became apparent to us that the market was changes The city of Austin was changing and product on the ground what is currently known as Austin oaks was not in fact the best use of the land Austin matured much faster than anyone in my industry could have managed and there was and really still is not enough product to support the growth in result and demand The 31 acres of land at the intersection of mopac and spice wood springs presented a great opportunity to address the citys growth demands after much consideration among ourselves we decided to seek zoning in order to meet market demands We began that in 2014 t wo years after we purchased the property Suffice it to say the neighborhood was not as enthusiastic about Austins growth so we reset with the neighbors in 2016 As you are well aware we participated and the end plan hundreds of hours of debate and exper tise of legal design engineering experts Since that plan the plan was refined to the point acceptable by staff and various board decisions to obtain ultimate approval at this level Nonetheless I respect authority of this council and under the plan they r equire additional modifications to meet standards for approval As I said before the while the plan is not a plan I would propose it can work as mixed use community Nonetheless Im aware of notions which may be made which are _ Sir I believe this was actually the document provided the update time of the document itself and the printing time and this could be actually probably forensically proven _ Hi my name is SHAWN Co mpton Im one of the planners on the project We were hired to work on the sure and there after we continued to work on the project to finalize the land use plan Our previous  I like to speak to the parking garage And I would like to own up to an erro r on my part We use 12 feet as the first floor module for the garages And that accommodates the commercial uses As we began we brought on an architect and for loading and offloading we learned that 15 feet is the requirement What I di d not account for was a three foot beam above the 15 foot clear zone for the parking  excuse me for the loading and unloading The rationale for why we have about 15 feet remains the same And thats for minimizing cover by having the parking  excuse me the loading and unloading within the parking garages minimize impervious cover And to allow for commercial and retail uses I know Michael is mentioned Its oversight and councilmember alter has also mentioned this and I humbly request that you add three feet to the overhaul height of the garages to accommodate for the offloading  for the  for the offstreet loading and unloading And I would like to thank you and answer any questions that you might have _ He mentioned to the garage but not all of the garages Theres a total of six garages on there He didnt mention all the garages _ On the last reading it simply was  Ill read it out The new ordinance and back up to allow up to 8 of the required affordable housing to be met with it as follows on here  And so Ill explain it after I get a second _ What this does as Ill recall we added two floors of office for abou t 16 million in community benefit on last reading 800000 of that was dedicated to affordable housing This amendment states that at the  at the citys option not the developers option The citys option the city can acquire affordable housing on site or take the money and spend it in the area around Austin oaks and around Austin oaks to leverage affordable housing opportunities So this does not create any additional benefit for the developer This creates more options for the city It would be at the discretion of  the neighborhood housing director to make this call and I would respect the authority of the neighborhood housing director to make the decision about the opportunities at the time and whether or not its best to get the units at the si te or to utilize it there _ The neighborhood housing and community development department The fee would be flexible We could look and work with your department to identify an initiative or activity that could be best served for this particular issue But I dont see that there would be any kind of restrict ions on the funding source that would preclude ap array of different activities _ Look at the changes were putting in the restrictive covenant It requires it to be done with the first commercial housing units and it wouldnt be done late in the day It will be done  its up front They make that decision _ We could come up with some kind of consumer price index or something Im su re theres language that we could draft _ Mr Whalen is saying theres no escalation in the analysis of our rents so we would want  we would want to take a little time to  to reflect on that So I think that we could think about some language that might address that if thats the will of the council _ Hi Mr Whalen Law I think  this is cover in the information that you saw The analysis they did did not include any escalation to market rents over the 40 year period And so that was a concern of ours They said rents will increase There could be some escalator to the rents in the 40 year period The analysis do not I do not think it matters based on a flat rate over a 40 year period it doesnt matter at what point this will be made Because the rate the rent hasnt changed So in my opinion if theres going to be an adjustment made based on when it happens there needs to be a cpi escalator or something similar to adjust the rents on an annual basis based on a 40 year period _ Vicinity can be defined in a reasonable geographic you know location to the pud We have  this will be something that will be a little different than what weve done and the other like for example transit or oriented districts I would say potentially half a mile is typically what we have offered up and other density bonus programs I would put that forward fo r consideration at this time Unless theres a specific area that we need to go out a little bit further to take a look at _ I would say I would want to have some flexibility working with the actual district representative Thats typically what weve seen We would be comfortable saying in the vicinity _ I want to clarify we have parking accounted for because were going see some as we go through other amendments that we dont violate that So its 60 feet of the parking garage accommodates that so you can get that out of the way _ I will remind you as we discussed in work session that if councilmember Poole was here we have the votes to pass this so well have to have a postponement if it doesnt pass _ So Im going to note that this is for four and five and where it reads 50 feet to be consistent with earlier decisions should read 53 feet So I move to meant part 5 of the ordinance and back up to limit any height or structure in parcels 4 and 5 to 53 feet and to move 10 8a to require any amendments B through K will be considered a substantial amendment Use on the ground floor parking garage 3 above the ground floor Its limited to 53 feet Its the same thing on building 6 My intention is for the restaurant to be on the ground floor and the parking above And there was ambiguity in the land use plan that we are trying to resolve And we would just want to be clear we had previously added  the last time something to deal with this notification issue and its just repeating it here for clarity _ I think were fine doing that I think because the situation is changed and not as attractive as the free standing because of the movement of the office if we could have as we could preview a few more uses and we had identified four that would help to make sure that gets occupied initially It would be for financial services There could be a small banking type situation general retail sales convenience which was mentioned Personal services That gives us flexibility to fill that space _ The only thing were concerned about that I expressed to you earlier is the market is such that we shou ld remain empty The restaurant does yield a better rent they just wont support that and will remain empty as weve seen on Cesar Chavez in the CNC buildings _ My only concern is that with the state law regarding grandfathering if we do agree to the city lags because it would adhere because everyone else says that the regulations in effect at the time of the application would apply unless theyre modified And so by doing this they say 281 d you have frozen 281 d as to this development if we in the future for example strengthen that provision that strengthened provision would not apply And Im pretty sure thats not the intent _ We can do that we have found in our deliberations at times the language is to do the language now  thats why and the pud and make sure that this doesnt provide anything beyond the particul ar modification _ Theres been suggestions about applicants in the past that dont have the sections that comply and you said no we wont do that is that it gives them a benefit rather than tying them  it ties them to something that we may strengthen in the future So I would advise against it because it will apply to them Pursuant to the terms of the code _ Mayor pro tem Environmental officer I agree with the city attorneys advice on that We generally really try to stay away from including references to exist ing code that they would have to comply with any way and  and this is something that for a long time theyve been real clear they know they have to comply with the cef requirements and the litigation requirements and in fact theyre limiting the depth of excavation and so if we were to  if  as you were saying if we were to strengthen the regulations in the future they might not have to comply with them and my recommendation would be that we remain silent on it _ Yes as they do for any trenches excavating the parking garage They start work reporting to us Our geologists and inspectors respond and evaluate those and comply with the litigation requirements Theyre required to report them to the tcq But then tcq defers to us because we can respond faster and have more stringent regulations than the state do es so they have to comply with those _ Things are attributing to me when other people talk It happens all day when we talk On the  on the subtitles It says troxclaire So if anybody is  if youre wil ling to fix that _ The part 8 in backup to reduce the height of the parking garage on three So instead of being 85 feet 75 feet or 7 12 levels _ Again those four uses are general retail sales and convenience personal services which is nails hair and pet services _ Yeah the concern is we loo ked at it aggregately and said we have X amount of square foot of quote retail and restaurant And the restaurant within some of that We start identifying a very specific piece and saying that has to be a restaurant Thats a bit more concerning because I dont know if a rest restaurant tour is going to show up and want to lease that space maybe the space down the way I would say the concept has changed when we inserted the retail spaces or restaurants whatever you want to call it into the garage versu s it being in the stand alone path site _ Its in a period of time to  to allow those three uses for a certain number of years and then convert to just restaurant _ Im wo ndering if it would be appropriate to consider the language that has a preference for a restaurant Restaurants were really  I have to say in this market restaurants are dying all the time And we can see that there are empty spaces all over the city S o Im not certain to get at what neighbors are interested in if theres some way to write the language that you know if its a restaurant if it at all possible or something to that effect so that these other uses would be secondary if you cant get a restaurant And so that seems to be what youre saying it also seems to be perhaps whats being reflected in the restaurant But we do need to be realistic in this city Restaurants are tough Its tough to keep going The restaurants come and go and come and go So a vacant space Im sure is not what the neighbors would prefer I mean theyd rather have a restaurant but they might rather have something else rather than nothing So if there was some way to make it clear that the preference is restaurant and if you have some responsibility for trying to get a restaurant in there I dont know how to word that exactly then perhaps that would address the issue _ We can bui ld up to  my understanding is we can build up to 500000 square feet of office at which time we have to deliver at least 250  oh we have to deliver on parcels 8 and 9  develop parcels 8 and 9 which are the  what are we calling that Ao mixed use before we can develop another square foot of office space _ It  it goes back to the thing about garages right These havent been designed  These havent been planned Weve kind of  this is all based on planning exercise and not in depth architectural design So I dont know definitively how many units are going to be on site there Im comfortable with the range thats on the table And I think it provides some protection that in fact the affordable units will be on the ground But Im concerned about the notion of putting in the what we term as the best case maximum number and making that now a minimum number when in fact it hasnt bee n designed it hasnt been  it hasnt been drawn by an architect _ Mayor I obviously most important to the neighbors is reducing the floor In terms of the  in the resi dential and the garage That goes with it Im not sure what youre suggesting or putting for the minimum If 250 is the number and that was 27 or 108 I would refer that to be higher that I would prefer that to be 41 The issue here is th at I think the whole deal was predicated on the notion of delivering the residential Yes we did discuss the strategic housing plan today And it was all predicated on delivering the residential whether it was the affordable or the income or the market r ate or the market rate or income restricted We have protection for this being built This is one way to encourage that I would like to see something somewhere in between the 25 and the 41 number On the parking level you know Im okay with what you prop osed but I do want to point out that thats just having them lob off three feet Thats really not  its  I think its an improvement to make a  _ If you take off a half a level and give them three feet youve only take n off three feet It needs to be done but not as big of a give as it sounds I think I would like to see the other On the restaurants I preferred your suggestion of having an interim time period if that was feasible I think not having restaurants in th is area will be problematic But I understand the applicants need to have the traffic there which would come with the residential And I dont know if theres a halfway point there _ Okay To me a half a floor is six feet If you give them an additional three feet earlier youre only getting three feet _ We can  I have an idea to address that I think We could  we can  I hope it depends on what Mrs Co tton said but we can certainly volunteer to make that space available to restaurant use first at the  the rent that we were offering to and we leave it at the same represent were not going to have a hype rent and lower the rent The right of first ref usal Make that available to restaurant use first for 60 days before we make it available generally for a commercial  for the other four uses that I had mentioned  Mentioned We can do that each time it turns over to your point to councilmember Garza  when it turns over make it available for restaurant use first _ I believe that would be impossible for the city ordinance The city is  our role is to do permanent buildings So once a building is built we dont keep track on a monthly basis of who the tenant is But we could encapsulate that in a letter and stick it in the file and say this is the councils intent that this be done But I dont thin k that is enforceable language for an ordinance _ Councilmember Garza raises a good point with respect to shifting with the tenant So I will go with your statement on  _ On the parcel Yes I do want to point out that we are only getting 25 or  I dont know did we decide on 27 or 25 Whats the number Its 27 _ Im sorry to interrupt you I just want to clarify one of the other parts with respect to the restaurant was that we wanted to limit the height to the parcel not just to the structure so that you wouldnt have any ambiguity about adding the 30 to the 50 So that the height was  that the height of the building or structure on parcel 4 was limited to the 53 feet _ Slow down Please explain it again because now I felt like it was an amendment to the amendment so please explain</th>\n",

complaints I know well inspect the units for deficiencies and problematic issues I was wondering why this did not occur quicker I had a phone call last year about this property Unfortunately I was in the hospital again so I was not able to address it with you But in the future thats more pertinent and more efficient in listening to the complaints of the resident I understand that the owner has been cited or will be cited But thats not enough Number 15 is th e Austin community college increased funding for child care equality Any increase for child care equality is a no brainer Child  children  child needs health care and theyre not getting it A lot of people in east Austin A lot of children are not g etting top care at the childrens hospital Ive seen it They say call the mayor Thats your job You said number 16 Number 16 is just a increasing for the community network and Raul is the the executive director of the organization Called the communit y action network Thats money well spent for the community And again mayor Number 16 _ 17 Okay yes 17 appropriating 170000 grant funds for the Austin shelter Always supportive of women and especially children who ar e at risk These children are at risk mayor council They need this funding for actually appropriate needs immediate needs So this is an appropriate  appropriate funding for the Austin children for women and children Ill always support them You sa id number 18 right Number 18 has to do with increased mentoring is a no brainer Former teacher at ACC Austin independent school district And I taught also juniors in college But mentoring is very important to get the kids back on tra ck on education and the last item mayor And allow me to  Usa today good article about homeless veterans in Austin Texas Coming to Austin because he said he knows for a fact that there are more than 5000 homeless veterans in Austin Texas FYI I like to work with you and your office on that if it would be okay _ Thank you may you mayor pro tem and councilmembers Im David king Speaking on item 27 regarding the city manager search advisory task force I think its important task force Glad youre taking an initiative to make sure the community is involved i n the process I think youre suggesting that I believe this will happen The task force the membership reflecting the diversity of our community and I hope you will allow the task force to comply with the Texas open meetings laws and not allow lobbyists to be appointed to this important task force Thank you very much for listening to my comments _ They very quickly will do this Theyll take the consent agenda Well ask people if they did the full three minutes Andy young will get called when we have item 26 The items pulled now are 9 10 14 19 22 24 25 and 26 Is there a motion to approve the consent agenda Ms Houston makes that motion Is there a second Mr Casar any discussion _ Thank you members Matthew assistant attorney I wan t to approve a settlement amount of 250000 in the city of Austin lawsuit As discussed in executive session on April 4 this lawsuit is related to an automobile versus pedestrian incident that occurred on January 26 2016 As a result of the accident sh e suffered significant injuries In exchange for the settlement the city will obtain a full and final agreement that releases the city and city employees from claims that were or could have been asserted in the lawsuit The law department recommends that you approve this payment of the settlement amount pursuant to these terms Any questions _ Is there a motion to approve item 9 Councilmember Garza is our second in this Councilmember Renteria Any discussion Those in favor of the proposed settlement please raise your hand Those opposed Unanimous on the dias with Ms Poole off Thank you very much _ Mayor pro tem councilmembers I think its important that were doing this Im hopeful that this property you know doesnt end up being demolished and replaced with market rate housing What we have done and we have to do this we have to help these families But Im concerned that were going to end up facilitating the demolition of affordable housing Is there any way we ca n hold the property accountable for repairing this property and allowing the families to come back in Low income families other families to come back in and remain in the neighborhood Im just very concerned about this And I think this is really import ant that we use this as an opportunity to look down the road and see in other parts of our city where is this about to happen again Which of our other properties are like this where the property owners are not taking care of them Theyre becoming dilapid ated becoming unsafe Thats an excuse for go get some tenant relocation money and then clear out and were going to clear out for market rate housing They have a term for this in cities like Austin where this is occurring Its called r ecolonization Existing residents are pushed out and being recolonized by affluent high income families Im not criticizing those families I know thats part of the  part of the system part of the process that were trying to deal with I understand t hat But we have to find different ways to see this Otherwise diversity of color low income families from our central neighborhoods Then our only tool seems to be lets provide density bonus housing and we have families pushed out of single family hous ing that they could afford and their only alternative is to come back and live in an apartment a small apartment And they do well that way So Im concerned about this I appreciate this item I know we had to do this But we need to see where else is th is about to happen And figure out a way that we can hold those property owners accountable now to bring the properties into compliance and safe for the tenants Thank you very much _ Assistant city attorney The state law that requires us to fund the reloc ation does not authorize us to reimburse  seek reimbursement under that statute _ Its subject to two orders that have generated civil penalties and the city is authorized under state law to do a collection action to recover those funds _ Im not su re how we  when we traditionally take  to recover civil penalties if it would follow that process If the council wanted to direct those moneys we could address that at that time _ Not under th is particular action But its something we can look into to see if that money can go to the housing trust fund Well get back to you on that question _ The state law doesnt require that we recover the expenses Does the state law  it allows u s to this But doesnt provide  can you explain it a little more _ Texas property code requires the city to provide relocation advisory services and financial assistance for relocation when activities cause displacement koez enforcement activities ca use displacement _ Correct Does it specify the amount I had someone calling the office asking about the appropriateness of the amount not necessarily questioning th e need for relocation But I wanted to give you an opportunity to talk about that briefly _ State law does not set a minimum It sets a maximum of the federal benefits so we would not be able to exceed federal benefits but we do not have a minimum _ Is the 600000 is it  is it 40000 per unit or am I  Im sorry I dont have it in front of me Do you know _ The office of real estate Yes it was attached to it as backup The total amount was 40000 Estimated Perez den shl tenant _ Similar to the programs that we used on the flood buyouts Its th e same calculation that we do This one were using a 30 month calculation The estimated rental assistance payment is 2500 for the benefit of moving as well But the calculation the same as the buyouts where we find a comparable property subtract the subject property rent Multiply it by the payment The federal law has a statutory of 700000 Theres a resort where we can pay up and above to the maximum of what that calculation will be _ Its a  spend toget type of program They woul d be made eligible But if they found a property that they pay 450 500 There may be a small amount of that difference that we would be able to extend to them and for them to be able to claim _ Mayor Can I get c larification of those extensionse limb natded Or are they on the table to come back at 36 months and request an extension _ A matter that after 36 months we either go back for another request for an rfi for  from the banks or we come back to council and request an extension _ Good morning SHAWN Willett purchasing This was proposed as 36 months with the cost of each of the options included The contract would be awarded that way but it would be contingent on if we were to come back to the council and receive that additional approval for one of the options but the pricing would be award in this amount _ I think theyre self contained Because they were  they relate to what happens after  unlike the other  unlike 10 and the other changes were considerin g on 10 those all impact whats within the housing plan right now These other two are complementary and they have to do with what happens after and so I think theyre distinct enough that we can go forward with them I mean everybody thats speaking as i n favor of those two I think we should go ahead and do that That will reduce some of the potential for confusion later _ Mayor mayor pro tem and councilmembers Im an dei young and Im a resident of universal hills district I speaking on item 26 Quick voir dire my family came to Austin nearly 100 years ago when my great uncle was elected to the Texas legislature then attorney general eventually appointed chief justice of the supreme co urt of justice by governor pat Neff My family is so proud of Austin and as always been active here More importantly Im speaking to you as a former crime scene investigator to the Los Angeles police department scientific investigation division I have six service years there I processed over 6000 crime scenes and my unit responded to over 200 crime scenes every 24 hours That is only 15 of what the police officers actually responded to Im not comparing our wonderful city Austin to Los Angeles But Im here today to say please dont make the same mistakes they did Learn from their mistakes The population of metro Austin has grown to under 2 million people and were playing catchup with the infrastructure We also need to pay catchup with the poli ce department Were short handed with just over 1900 sworn police officers serving nearly 2 million people A growing k 2 epidemic with over 6000 incidents in the last five years approximately 300 this year alone and the fifth year runn ing one of the largest  one of the fastest growing cities in the nation we need to let the police department grow with the city As all of us APD wants to be a proactive part of the city not just reactive They will need more officers to do this So I m asking us to please allow them to hire more officers I know budgets and taxes But I have seen firsthand what not having enough police officers on the streets can do to a city and we do not want that to happen here in Austin Thank you for your time _ Thank you mayor council Im Travis Wesley Im a native austinite I live in district 5 Im also the president of class citizen led Austi n safety partnership On behalf of the class we fully support the resolution to bring the city manager to identify resources to combat the k 2 crisis The city council in the past has asked for several studies and those studies recommended to fill the pol ice department to fully staffed We support that Without filling these positions were opening ousts up to more crime downtown And then spilling out into our neighborhoods If we dont combat this issue going on right now I  I think its going to get worse and worse if they dont combat it now So thank you for your time I appreciate it And have a great afternoon _ Thank you Im not going to take that much time Thank you mayor mayor protell Im David Roche president of the greater Austin crime commission We support the wisdom with which youre attacking this problem We thank you We believe youre on the right track We do believe we need m ore officers Past the point to the fact that we need more officers on the street As we attack this problem downtown we hope that you wont be pulling officers from outside the neighboring areas and the suburbs I think if you do decide to hire more offi cers for this problem youre going to get closer to your 35 goal for your  for the mayors council on institutional racism Youre going to get closer to the 35 goal on commune the I policing that Dr Rich obrady spoke to We fully support what your e doing Thank you _ Im Gus Pena Served with the director of the irs the bailiff at criminal district courts I will tell you this much I s ee k2 incidents daily I use a bus because I cant drive right now to use my  my surgeries but eighth and lavaca is one of the most serious areas Our proposal was to move the Salvation Army and the arch to levande rks loop Unfortunate ly I have a dog that saved my life from a rattlesnake So I will say I understand about the animal pet shelter over there That would have been the best place because it had a clinic it had a theater it had lodging and everything So we missed out on a good opportunity to move these end the is over there to  not to push the people out there because theyre human beings and I love them But I will tell you this much k2 is an increase I talk to several officers over there And Ive identified several when I go to case manage at the Salvation Army veterans service It is on the increase This is an epidemic worse than alcoholism worse than any other vicious vicious drug or alcohol  or beverage that I have seen and it needs to be addressed holistic ally Not being addressed holistically its piece maehl We have to get rid of it Its over there Once you go over there mayor put on your blue jeans or whatever and go see what I have This the combat This is combat Combat to save the lives of peop le and I had one individual to get the bus on eighth and lavaca I had to dodge him He brought him around APD was there I appreciate APD We need more officers I spoke to the public safety commission also We need more officers Boots on the ground bu bba We dont need them in the offices We need them out there to patrol That will be great too I hope they dont get angry with me But we need people to do the holistic approach Its a serious issue An epidemic But we need more help out there for sa fety personnel for their community and for the people already using the k2 and theyre abusing it bigtime mayor I hope you listen to whats going on Im more than happy to walk with you over there and show you where its at A lot of my veterans are on k2 I send them to clinics and the va hospital Thank you for allowing me to ramble It is an epidemic We need more boots on the ground we need more police officers Theyre doing a great job Thank you _ Mayor I wanted to confirm I put messages on the message board and want to make sure those are indeed a part of what were moving now _ Yes sir Thank you Mr Mayor Mayor I hate to do this to yall I go back to mayor Bruce Todds administration They mention affordable housing My retort or re sponse to that is affordable for whom We had a vision back there in 1990 92 94 95 about affordability lack of affordability What is different for you or me or us Im not disrespecting you It is just a general statement But anyway what I would like to see is this is we have adults in committees whatever studying  this is a problem It has been going on since Bruce Todds administration Heres a suggestion Mr Mayor councilmembers yall speak to high school students High school students are very very informative very very smart Lets get input from high school students not only high school students and ACC students that need affordable housing and ge t the different definition of what affordability is and what the needs are I heard a comment made about preserving housing for senior citizens Well Mr Mayor councilmembers Im a senior citizen I dont see too much senior citizen housing out there O k Us older veterans are to the point where were losing a lot of veterans my age And the military really is a hardship on everybody It tasks you to the 110  I have the verbiage I better not use what we use in the Marine Corps It taxes you to do mor e than you can So your physical fitness is not as good as it was when you are younger We need affordable housing I recommend we address this issue even at the high school level I met principals that want to allow students to be made accommodation to sp eak to yall in front of the council but theyre not able to make it because of scholastic issues Send out fliers to the high schools Get their input also Because theyre going to need affordable housing also Not just us There is a lack of real tru eblue affordable houses You ask anyone in the street is that affordable 1200 a month apartment is not affordable Anyway I will keep it short I was looking through item 10 Got a good article success story about the veterans I wan t to thank you You have been at the forefront for helping homeless veterans get housing Lets be honest You know there is a lot more homeless veterans out there And this is a real good story coming out of item 10 Read it I appreciate the hard work y ou do Mr Mayor Your leadership is topnotch Thank you for working get the students available included in this _ Thank you ma yor councilmembers my name is David king Im speaking on item 10 24 25 Items 10 24 25 Regarding the strategic housing plan Im glad youre taking public input on it I hope you will allow the zoning and planning commission to take public input an d provide feedback to you before you formally adopt it as part of the imagine Austin comprehensive plan Regarding item 24 the implementation of the plan and indter disciplinary action team for the housing plan I think this is important item that needs t o be passed Im glad  this shows youre serious about taking the plan and working the plan and implementing the plan I think this is very important that this particular item be approved What I would suggest is that we include  that we include look b ack process to look back and see how effective our housing strategies have been Like the density bonus programs and what goals do we have For example is a goal of the density bonus program to provide a variety of affordable housing Im talking about de tached single family housing or primarily a goal for apartments affordable apartments We need to have a metric that gives us input information And we need a goal thats clear I think it is important that we have a goal that says we want to help low in come families be able to live in detached single family homes where they can own them And gain wealth through that process Thats important and strategic I think we need goals to see how many of those homes have we produced How many do we want to produce We should have that level of granularity It seems like were putting all our eggs in the basket of affordable apartments And Im concerned that what were doing with whats going on the redevelopment of our community that were los ing the single family detached housing that low income families have today and replacing them with apartments And I dont think thats equitable So I think we need some metrics that talk about  that gives us insights into the average amount of land occ upied by low and middle income families versus high income families The relative percentage of low income families that live in single family detached housing versus apartments And Ive told you before that theyre consistently the real estate industry shows that families of all income levels of all colors by 75 or higher prefer to live in single family detached housing if they could afford it I think our housing policy should be informed by that We is have metrics and goals that give us insights in to that And one other suggestion that I have is that we include the office of equity in item 25 and regarding the resolution of preserve affordable housing along the corridors That is important for the office of kweshgsitty to be  equity to be involved in that as well Both of those Thank you very much _ Thank you mayor Mayor pro tem councilmembers for the opportunity to speak My name is Brennan griffin Im a native austinite to borrow something Mr Hirsch used to say like most of us austinites I rent I think it is very important to put some real housing goals into imagine Austin I think the strategic housing plan is a very good start I wonder if the number is even high enough Just taking into account regular population growth not actually trying to move the needle on affordability as far as I can tell from the way they calculated the 135 total units So I think that we should be looking carefully at that number getting concrete goals on affordable housing and on market rate as well really is impor tant I heard some comments in the prior public testimony sort of about zoning capacity I wanted to just relate that zoning capacity does not equal what actually gets built So we need to be sure as we consider codenext that were not sort of capping the capacity at additional 135 units we will think about what we will actually build as a result of the code next process So that you for the opportunity to speak Appreciate your service _ Hello Im also a long time austinite An austinite who rents Im here to testify in favor of adding more units to the strategic housing plan 35000 is not nearly enough We need a plan that keeps things from getting worse but need a plan to make things better Austin is in a n affordability and traffic crisis We are losing and lost many long standing low income residents and even some middle class residents What were doing is not sustainable environmentally fiscal and not sustainable fiscally People should be able to cho ose their neighborhood and not have it chosen but their socioeconomic status Inclusion should be the number one priority when it comes to how much housing we allow to be built Dont fall for the fallacy that the housing shortage isnt th e cause of the crisis When people are bidding on one house that drives up the price When landlords know tenants dont have good options they can and do jack up rents Were losing loss of old affordable units to renovation prices are going up because you dont build housing in places people want to live If you want to preserve old apartment complexes you need new apartment complexes built in old places not just on top of where it is allowed now Allow near more housing to be sure were being inclusiv e Most of the satellite cities where people are forced to drive By predicting most of our growth will be outside of the city limits and planning for that and basing 135 units with that idea in mind were creating a self fulfilling policy that will creat e environmentally destructive sprawl By forcing people that want to live in the cities to live in the suburbs producing them to buy more car produce more CO2 emission and more traffic We should focus on making it easier for people to drive less often and drive shorter distances Not making it easier to drive long distances No one is saying single family housing should go away entirely We should allow more smaller houses on smaller lots If you live in central Austin you shouldnt limit who can limit in your neighborhood to people who can afford single family houses The solution needs to focus on inclusion Aiming to make things better not just keeping from things from getting worse We should not be welcoming people back into neighborhoods they wer e pushed out of _ Tovo : Im happy  if I understand councilmember Garzas point and we will add them in parenthetically _ Robert spiller Austin transportation department I suspect wha t you were reading was strategic corridors or activity districts That may be where the confusion is The terms corridor districts doesnt ring a bell _ We concur and one thing we put forward during the need it is assessment as to if our funding is applicable from a regulatory standpoint to help repair we would certainly want to do what we can And we do believe that that is absolutely a housing option and solution for many households _ So my suggestion is that the only place where Ive used priority is in the be it resolved And we could simply take it out because I think its defined by the context of the resolution itself which talks about the corridors which will now actually cite the corridor study areas that are already included in th e corridor housing preservation tool And it talks about the creation and preservation of affordable housing for corridors throughout Austin beginning with those that receive funding through the mobility bond If we take out priority I b elieve that eliminates the confusion about which ones are priority corridors _ It all started in 06 when I approached Mike Martinez about cell phone use He blew me off I waited five long years He ran for mayor so I decided that was the right opportunity for payback Standing here I said vote for Steve Adler David Todd I said do not vote for Mike Then I told Mike this is payback Previously the council had the bright idea to boycott Arizona because of their immigration stance I hope they enjoyed the APD lab scandal and becoming a prop 15 They had to work to sneak it in Now its y our turn Thousands of dollars have been spent on research by the Texas department of transportation Ive got the answers right here Truck drivers refuse to take the toll roads Since you were brainwashed by Casar yall are in that traffic wasting time indirectly losing years of your life You are literally going to have a shorter lifespan because of time lost and because of pollution This is the ultimate payback I may decide to give the answers to the get city council if they are not a bunch of trai tors You wouldnt believe the most common response It was really weird in fact and weird And I got it all on my CV Theyre almost obsolete I dont have to worry about someone stealing this but there is always payback Previously I warned the others to let Acevedo go after he wanted to leave He department even stay a decade I did my homework Shouldve seen all the negativity coming from California You may say she doesnt like art or Casar and they are hispanic Im on a higher level Im for my country You see Im playing chess while some of yall are still playing checkers I conducted a brief survey last night and asked police officers how they liked Brian They said they loved him Media has said officers are nicer now Tha t was not the case with art People read between the lines He was brought in because he spoke Spanish All the attention was on art He was too social trying to win a popularity contest Officers did not like that attention was on him not the entire pol ice department We need Brian Manley Make it happen when the city manager says so and it is up for a vote He needs to become the next police chief This is his stomping ground Ive still got time I guess Ill repeat some of my stuff Previously the co uncil had the bright idea to boycott Arizona because of their immigration stance Boy I hope they enjoyed the lab scandal and the killing of prop 15 We said vote yes for everything except prop 15 Vote no Thats how we did it _ Soy Carlos and here I am in Austin Texas April 13th 2017 where I have lived continuously here in Austin for almost six years to speak whats right  First and foremost gracias a dios for discernment document one on screen now  To legally defend myself against the city attorneys filed bogus pedestrian in roadway charge March 31st I requested police vehicle dashboard camera video recording Thats nonresponsive basic information Attorney general paxtons op en records ruling 2016 10001 says must be released per the public information act because previous determination may not be used to withhold it Document two now Howevermiss Renee Moore admin administrative supervisor APD central records tried gasligh ting me by saying and doing the exact opposite in her April 3 2017 letter to me Willfully withholding it by blatantly disobeying Texas law and paxtons ruling which she claimed to have relied upon in writing Therefore miss Moore is allegedly guilty of official misconduct by intentionally impairing the availability of requested public information per Texas code of criminal procedure 304 and Texas penal code 3710 Thats a state jail felony because that loss harms me by disadvantaging me at trial Cam era on me now Her abusive lying criminal psychopathic behavior is not acceptable in any public servant position especially one with so much power over our lives How many other austinites has she done this to Therefore there can be no public trust i n or support of APD employing miss Moore as custodian in charge of police records Thats bad for APD but ugly for Austin which city council cannot allow Therefore do addition by subtraction Fire public servant Renee Moore asap The e vidence is right in front of you right now And its on public record for this meeting Drain the swamp right here in Austin _ Good afternoon mayor and council Im Greg Guernsey with the planning and zoning department Ill go through the 2 oclock zoning items First items where hearings have been closed then proceeding with the ones where hearing s have been open The first item that I can offer for consent approval is item number 34 This is for consent approval in all three readings I want to note for councils information that just before the meeting Alice Glasco who is the agent for the owne r let meco holdings LLC David corks cox has presented me a private districted covenant that has been executed but not yet recorded that speaks to that the rental units on the property 5 of the units will be at 60 mfi for 40 years and 5 of the units for rental will be at 80 for 40 years This is a private covenant It was mentioned at the previous meeting If the ordinance is approved by council today they will execute it And theyll present a copy to the city for our file So I wanted to make sure youre aware of that Item number 35 this is for consent approval on second and third readings Item number 36 is the oaks Mayor I know you had speakers And action will take place after the dinner break as said earlier Item number 37 is for consent approval on first reading only _ 37 is consent for first reading only And item number 38 we have an applicant request for postponement in may 4th And thats item number 38 _ Thats correct And as I mentioned there was a private restrictive covenant The owners agreed to do certain affordable housing for a period of up to 40 years 5 at 60 and 5 at 60 I have an execu ted copy of that covenant that would not be recorded _ No councilmember There do es not appear to be any language to that effect in the private covenant Were not a party to this covenant either _ Good afternoon councilmember Mayor and councilmembers  Alice Glasgow representing the applicant At the second reading the applicant had indicated that they didnt want to be tied down to percentages Were still committed to looking at that As to which mix that will entail But its not written in the co venant _ Yeah the development will have one and two bedroom units Thats the intent It s not intended to be all just one bedroom units but as far as the percentages of whats going to be allocated to the affordable unit housing percentages we dont have that determined _ It does not There were two cases the council approved The first one that was acceptable to the applicant And last time council the applicant was not willing to volunteer that at this time And I think councilmember  the mayor asked councilmember Renteria about a motion and th at item was dropped at your second reading discussion _ And you have copies  Im Joyce Im a board member of the northwest Austin civic association and Im speaking on behalf of the board today _ Thank you Mayor and counc ilmembers thank thank you for the opportunity to speak to you about the Austin oaks case Id like to focus my comments today on one word  respect First thank you for the respect to our community respecting our right to speak and providing us time i n the afternoon as well as evening so we can handle or  our existing commitments We respect the hours you have spent on this We agree with councilmember Garza that its no longer necessary to repeat our concerns Thus I expect to be the only one who i s testifying today We also respect the right of those who oppose the PUD To have their say and we hope they will keep their comments brief too Its time to bring this case to a decision Second we thank John and Michael for their respect for the ne ighborhood agreeing to and participating and for the many hours of work since Our zoning committee brought forward dozens of issues questions and requests for changes to ensure that the wishes of the neighborhood were accommodated in the PUD Submis sion That input was received with respect and the items were resolved amicably Third we thank the city council AIDS who work closely with us on this case always with respect for the needs of neighbors Louisa partnered with us and we really appreciat e their help This year Kurt has also been an excellent partner to us Fourth we thank the staff from a wide range of city departments planning and zoning parks and recreation watershed protection neighborhood housing and others who met with us an swered our questions with respect and helped us get to a good PUD Ordinance one that protects our neighborhood interests and binds the current and future owners to building a development thats consistent with the Charette design Out of respect to our neighbors and noaca members last night we considered carefully the current state of the PUD Ordinance given the changes during second reading and we approve the following resolution Whereas on April 12th 2017 the northwest Austin civic association naca board of directors met and considered this for the Austin oaks property as amended on second reading whereas the application received lengthy debate resulting in the adoption of multiple changes which is resulted in a significa nt departure in the new property design from the original Charette which the in board previously resolved to support whereas these changes would have a negative effect on the quality benefits and compromised reached during the Charette process whereas these changes include but are not limited to the addition of a new building with 175 residential units removal of the hotel addition of parking garages loss of additional trees and additional height on mopac and other areas therefore be it resolved by the northwest Austin civic association noaca board of directors that the board voted to and does oppose the rezoning application c18 2014 029 as amended upon second reading by the Austin city council We ask that as much as possible in your final deli berations today that you respect the outcome of the Charette in the final version of the Austin oaks PUD Ordinance that you create Again thank you and may you have an early evening finish today _ Good afternoon council and mayor My name is Madeline Im with the northwest Austin neighbors group Is front and back so it would be twice as big if it was wasting trees  every letter that has been written by citizens in district 10 and district 7 who have opposed the PUD And while we have all been participants in the Charette process and we do respect everyones right to speak we also have our right to speak too And we have worked tirelessly to put together a valid petition It was invalidated today We put in more names again today Were at 1984 missing 16 for a valid petition because of an easement in the road at spicewood springs that coordinating the 1989 ruli ng of our attorney general calls that to be city property so its not calculated in the metric With that strip of land removed were at 22 which is a valid petition And we do reserve our right to pursue that later but we dont want to do that We im plore you to look at the citizens again twice that size if you consider each letter not front and back on that stack who have written in noacas membership voted 80 against this PUD While we respect the boards authority to vote for it we implore you to listen to the citizens of the city you represent and vote no on this PUD And I wont take any more of your time I thank you for your service I know youre in a hard spot and you have to listen to all of us come up here and we appreciate that And I hope yall have a great day And please vote no _ Thank you for your testimony I just want to clarify what I just heard was that noaca does not support what passed on second reading So they are not currently supporting what is in the ordinance So there is actually currently agreement among the neighbors not to support _ The PUD As it came out of second reading And I would just like to say to both speakers that one of the problems that we have with the PUD Process is the way that it creates a dynamic thats very negative to our communities And I look forward to working with all of the neighbors in district 10 to move beyond that and reform the PUD Process _ Ive got a powerpoint to load up Good afternoon My name is Jose Hernandez Im a resident of green trails subdivision one of the petition signers Ive been in Austin since 1971 when I graduated from Texa s AM university And Im a registered professional engineer Ive been working with txdot for 28 years retired from there Ive got my own consulting company I have 47 years of design construction and maintenance of streets and highways And even thou gh I have a powerpoint Ive got to tell you that the thing that hits me the most is the traffic the amount of traffic thats going to be put on our neighborhood streets Not on mopac or spicewood but our neighborhood streets Nothing ha s been done about that There are no mitigation activities for our neighborhood streets You know heart lane is a rollercoaster up and down They probably cut it with a bulldozer following the guy going down thats how it was done no engineering design no safety considerations nothing You can see it right here on these slides starting on the left that car is going down the hill disappears goes up And at the very top is green trails And in between is hidden hollow and stone cliff drive These peo ple have to get out of there every day come in and come out every day Here is the cars coming up to green trails subdivision Thats our entrance You come up there and you have to take your life into your own hands when you start turning left And now with four or five times more traffic this is going to be a real problem You can see how theyre going down north to spicewood springs road Thats an intersection you can see in the far part of the picture Its executive drive and the intersection of hea rt lane and spicewood springs road Theres a lot of kids that walk to school They ride their bikes Its a big deal over there The people in apartments they walk there And so what are we doing about all this stuff To me the first thing is safety Sa fety of not only the people in their cars but also the pedestrians and neighborhood people We have to focus on that And we have not done that We should have a traffic study to focus on what we can do to keep most of that traffic or make it safe on our neighborhood streets This is the intersection of spicewood springs road and heart If you can see theyre going to put a traffic light How can you put a traffic light with all these spaghettis coming in at different angles You cant do it Usually if you have a 90 degree angle its easier to put a traffic light You cant do it here Here is lets see if I can get this thing going Its supposed to be a video But    Go back Okay Thats at heart lane and thats going towards  _ Going to the left its going to 360 And to the right its going to mopac Did you see that left turn onto heart lane Now here these cars are coming right here going to mopac Now theres somebody trying to turn left Now youve got to wait until s omebody gives you a shot and then you have to worry about the people on heart going left in front of you So its kind of like crazy See Hes still waiting there So Im looking at exhibit a where it was supposed to fix this Theres no traffic ligh ts for a left turn to turn left from hart to spicewood springs road The traffic signals for hart going to the right and turning left you cant see them because theyre placed at a different angle You cant put them where they need to be because of the g eometrics of that intersection So basically  and I think I sent you an email Each one of you has one of these charts that I sent you Basically you know youve got these problems Youre going to have to buy more right of way redesign the intersecti on reconstruct it and then put the signal lights How much is it going to cost Nobody knows And by the way the last thing is this is coming out of our subdivision That building right there that you see that light colored building thats going to g o away Thats where the park is Is five stories and a parking garage thats seven levels Theres nothing you can do to hide that Thats facing our neighborhood So what have we got to do why do we have to have stuff like that Why can t we have less Anyway thank you so much Appreciate your time _ I just wanted to clarify well be taking off the notes after the dinner hour assuming were done with any prior business before then _ Council good afternoon I want to say for mayor pro tem and councilmember Houstons benefit David king and I enjoyed a very nice lunch today So the miracle on second street continues I would urge you to adopt the housing plan but not as an element or amendment of imagine Austin I dont think that the change in the posting from taking action to amend imagine Austin to makin g it an element of imagine Austin has addressed the problem on pages 223 and 224 And despite any legal opinions to the contrary its my view that you cannot simply ignore those pages or the procedure for amendment that is set forth in the m As far as the target number I think you need to do at least two things  one is to add the 48000 current deficit in affordable housing in income restricted housing that exists today If we pass a housing plan that doesnt try to solve the current affordable housing problem that seems to me to be improper As I said last week the planning commission voted 6 6 on a motion to raise the number by 48000 So you need to do what the planning commission almost did with respect to the target Also Id like you to consider Peter parks comment to me a couple of months ago in terms of affordability vis avis codenext and that was that you cannot again to impact price in any significant way until you create a significant oversupply of housing And thats your consultant speaking They didnt do that in Denver the last place that Peter got a code adopted And since that code has been in place the last seven years Denvers median price has risen 20 faster than ours has under our current code So I would ask that you seriously take into account those two numbers whatever they are 48000 plus whatever in addition to the 135 Thank you council _ Hello My name is Jay Im execut ive director of a nonprofit think tank called farm and city I live in district 7 in a traditional duplex I think from the 50s I have a masters in public policy from the lbj school and have worked for Texas nonprofits focused on regiona l growth and housing and transportation policy for the last decade My overall comment is to urge that the target 135000 number be seen as a lower bound and not an upper limit on the amount of houses we need in Austin over the next like 20 25 Some thin gs I want to share with you the official campo regional forecasts that are used to plan all of our transportation infrastructure say that we will add 2132080 people by 2040 to reach 4120000 people over 78966 more people every year on average The ci ty of Austins currently 44 of the region and to maintain that regional share we should add 34900 more people every year Or about 13960 houses However I know that the regional campo forecasts are highly problematic They use data from the Texas stat e demographer that the demographer recommends using for short range planning And they allocate a ridiculous amount of growth to hays and Williamson county An outcome should be achieved with current development patterns and car dependent transportation systems is a nightmare of transportation Cap cog on the other hand uses the data recommends be used for short range planning predicting 12 million less people in the region than campo does The flawed campo forecast impacts the allocation of transportat ion dollars across the region and the citizens of Austin are getting less than we deserve It impacts capital metros project connect process and means that we cannot optimize that project And txdots studies that claim endless traffic a re based on the flawed forecast So to whatever extent you push growth outside the city you are increasing regional vehicle miles traveled You are increased our carbon footprint and you are increasing traffic When you look at the memo the demographer s ent you youll see hes lobbying hard for continuing the sprawl pattern in the Austin region an odd thing for city staff to do However he seems to be using the cap cog data which is intended for long range planning not the campo data appropriate for short range planning His projections for city growth through 2025 contain a radical change in the citys growth patterns also _ I guess Ill finish the thought The city demographers numbers show that the rate of the change of growth in the city of Austin will radically decrease over the next five years something that I do not think is a realistic projection And the numbers that you have on housing are based on that So please consider something more like 190000 houses as a lower limi t on what we need in the city of Austin And that would only keep things the way they are _ Thank you mayor  examine mayor protem and members of the Austin city council Although Im involved in many things and I was serving as the co chair of the working group on real estate and housing of the mayors special task force on institutional racism and all of the things that we dealt with in that I want to speak as a private citizen based on my work in that because I want to recommend some additions to the strategic plan particularly if it is going to be an addendum to imagine Austin I concur with the previous two speakers that we probably do need to state a number of housing units that we know we are down and need to move up My understanding from the housing department right now that number is around 60000 and probably as we speak its going up because as we have more people moving in we have a larger need for affordable housing Now going to the report from the work group there were actually two major recommendations made And I think that we need to have language along these lines included in the strategic plan One is that the city of Austin intends to plans to or will create a specific fund a local fund And we gave a number of ways that that fund could be achieved to create housing not just affordable housing but to cr eate a comprehensive program to redress institutional racism in Austin real estate and housing Related to that is we call upon the city of Austin to recognize and redress the racial injustices that were caused at least in part by prior city policies and the on going systemic inequities that continue After all you know we are the large city in the United States with the highest economic and racial segregation Thats not something we want to be proud of Were considered Progressive We want to get past that And I know you all agree with that Now thinking about the specific things that Id like to add within that comprehensive program on page 23 of the report we talk about Portland They had a criteria for bringing former residents back to gentrified areas And we think that that would be a good place to start in looking at redressing racial injustice So thats item 221 under fair housing and the right to choose Under 231 under rental housing again following Portlands lead th ere is an application that Portland is working with the private developer to put into place right now that we think Austin should also look into doing And that would help both developers  yall making decisions and people trying to move into Austin  find affordable housing units so that apartments that have affordable housing whether they are ones that we are approving right now or ones in the past that those units be placed on this application so that a person coming into town can find out hey th eres something over here and thats fairly close to where Im going to be working And thats a fairly simple thing that we could do that would really help everybody Yall because you would have information to finally make some decisions on instead of h aving to look at the demographers information and sort of extrapolate from that You would know exactly where the units are And then we had made some suggestions for the right to stay And we think that one of the things thats really important is helpin g people who are long term residents of minority neighborhoods or formerly minority neighborhoods in Austin to help them with  former councilmember Raul was involved in a nonprofit that works with the valley neighborhood and has expanded a bit to offer a onetime only payment for property taxes that the person may have fallen behind in They dont just do this onetime thing they then train the people on how to predict how much they need to be saving each month to be able to keep up with their property tax es and help them find people who can help them protest tax increases And we recommend that that be expanded to help a lot more people than just one neighborhood And another thing that we think is very important  that I personally want t o recommend  is that we have the chief equity officer use the new equity lens thats being developed to look at housing projects specifically in currently or previously minority neighborhoods to try and help ensure that we dont continue to push poor peo ple of color completely outside the city Thank you _ May I ask a question Did the equity officer weigh in on the housing plan thats before us were they included in that discussion maybe on hcd _ Thank you so very much One of the things that we did include in our report is true stories of people who have had to leave And I hope you read those because they kind of give you the personal feel for what its like Thank you _ Good afternoon Im waiting for my powerpoint show to be pulled up My name is Evan gill Im here today as a private citizen I recently moved to district 5 Im happy to be in councilmember kitchens district So I wanted to take a look at the numbers set forth in the strategic housing plan And Im generally in favor of this plan Im glad that were putting some numbers to the problem so that we have you know a goal to shoot for But I want to take a look at how we achieve the needed number of hous ing units for each you know income range and whether you know we have the capacity and the funding to be able to do that by 2025 So I was messing around in excel this morning And I decided to calculate essentially taking a look at annual rent grow th between now and 2025 what the funding gap or what amount of subsidy would be required to subsidize the number of units for one full year So this is an annual figure And I will  after I walk you through this chart I will kind of exp lain my calculations in a little more detail But if were able to reverse market rate and rent increases by 2 a year  so this is annual rent growth of 2 then the funding gap in year 2025 would be about 128 million I shouldnt say funding gap but that would be the amount of subsidy required to house this number of people or to create this number of housing units If we go back to 10 annual rent growth which is about the rate of growth we saw between 2008 and 2014 then that figure jumps to 1335 billion annually And you know thats a very difficult number for us to achieve on an ongoing annual bases going forward from year 2025 So the way I calculated this is for each income bucket I calculated  and this is assuming that the current median rent is 1300  approximately 1300 as put forth in the plan So based on that number I compounded on an annual basis up to 2025 what rent would be And for example at the top this is assuming 2 rent growth which would drive market rate rents down to 1106 Assuming 10 annual rent growth and assuming people can spend up to a third of their income on rent _ So to summarize my findings basically unless we can build enough market rate housing units were not going to be able to stret ch our subsidized dollars far enough to close the housing gap and to provide enough units _ Council mayor city manager I am Paul Hilgers the CEO of the Austin board of realtors I served as the director of neighborhood housing and community development for ten years Ive been involved in housing issues for a long time Im here to congratulate you on the vision and leadership youre providing by setting out bold goals visions You have to know where you want to go if youre going to try to get there The only couple of things that I would highlight for you is that you do need to do what you did this morning and follow through on looking specifically at corridors and how you can create a diverse level of housing for diverse families along these corridors And I think that would be helpful The second thing is there is an existing gap that you need to incorporate into the total amount of housing that you want You might as well think big And you might as well go for creating a diversity of housing stock that would meet the needs of this city I would highlight for you that the Austin board of realtors is about 12000 strong Youre going to hear from some of our leadership after me The board of realtors does a very deliberate process for analyzing issues And included in that is our legislative management team We look at these very carefully We take on issues are balanced reasoned and diverse and take into consideration the needs of neighborhoods families and this city The major point I would ask the city council to conside r today is to please recognize and reach out not just to this interdepartmental group which the city needs to include and I congratulate you on that but you need to reach out to the other institutions in this city You need to ask the co unty cap metro ACC and aid to get involved in the fundamental element of creating housing opportunities You need to ask the private sector and the employers to figure out how they can use housing as an opportunity to do recruitment and retention of the ir employees because until we all as an institution  as institutions and citizens get involved in supporting this major goal which is going to require  Im not sure its as much money as we just heard about but its a lot of money and its going to r equire more than just the city of Austin I congratulate you on your leadership and going forward with this I congratulate the staff of the neighborhood housing and community development department and the leadership of the city and the city manager for b ringing this forward And we look forward to continuing to work to push through issues of codenext and issues of rewriting the land development code in a way that works positively and proactively with the private sector to achieve the public benefits that this city needs and wants to achieve And so we look forward to continuing to work And we urge your support of this plan Thank you _ Good afternoon mayor mayor pro tem councilme mbers My name is bill Morris I am a working real estate professional here in the city of Austin I am a past chair of the legislative management team at the board of realtors that Mr Hilgers just mentioned Im a director at the board of realtors This year I chaired a policy team which is focused on growth and development issues in particular codenext And so Im bring that context with me to the discussion this afternoon We support the goals of the strategic housing plan With attention to what code next says about how to incorporate changes we do encourage you to adopt this as an element of  codenext or imagine Austin and to incorporate it as a part of the plan I do ask you to make sure that as you do that you incorporate metrics into the plan On pages 223 and 224 that youve heard mentioned before in imagine Austin theres discussion of annual and five year performance monitoring And that is intended to driv e changes to the plan as time goes by I would add a note that we are skeptical about being able to achieve everything thats needed in 3 of the city Thats not an awful lot of land Ive not done the math to see how many square miles that is but it wil l be very dense in that area in my estimation More importantly I ask you to keep the end in mind Codenext is the reason were all here And actually what allows the strategic housing plan to get the visibility it is The truth is we need a lot more t han 135000 units Youve heard the 135000 will keep us even with where we are right now and thats assuming the population doesnt outrun that growth But were not going to be able to build and control the cost of every unit thats needed We need a fa cility that allows the market to participate in deciding what gets built and where and at what cost Id also ask you to take the large view of this This is not just about the city of Austin Obviously all of you were elected by constituents in the city  But our ineffective code and development permitting process right now is actively exporting low  and middle income workers and families to the suburbs With them we are driving housing supply housing affordability issues miles around Were pushing th e transportation requirements that are complicated enough just inside the city many miles away and complicating commutes for everyone involved Water other infrastructure requirements all are being pushed into the suburbs _ And you get the picture here The point is that the decisions youll make in the coming months are not affecting just the city of Austin Theyre affecting what central Texas looks like and lives like in the next 20 40 years in maybe a 40 mile radius or farther from the city of Austin We appreciate your help _ Hi Thanks for letting me come today Im speaking as a private citizen and scientist Im truly grateful the city of Austin ha s put emphasis on affordable housing at this time It is disappearing so rapidly I have issues with the plan which contains directives which align the concepts of the free market to solve the affordable housing problems rather than building a concrete ho using fund that could really work My first concern is that the imagine Austin plan is to be amended with this document before codenext is worked out I urge you not to do that And then theres specific points that Im going to bring up At least 75 of n ew housing units should be within a half mile of imagine Austin centers and corridors The way this concept was presented at the affordable housing workshop I attended was that there should be no single family housing within a quarter mile of any bus route  I clarified that it was route and not stop My neighborhood which was built as a working class housing neighborhood houses averaging 850 square feet has five houses not within that area  that boundary Another part of the document says maintain existing homes affordable to community members but the policies for implementation imply massive removal of existing housing stock to make room for these new units The areas targeted will be those with smaller units Now there is allowed th e development of smaller houses on smaller lots This is a great concept for city land or new subdivisions but Im concerned about what it will do to existing neighborhoods with the formation of micro lots Relaxed regulations on both internal and externa l accessory dwelling units ads If you are serious about ads being built for affordable housing limit their size and prevent them from being used as short term rentals Theres a big section on the relationship between parking requirements and affordabil ity assuming that if you remove the parking requirements all of a sudden therell be a whole lot of affordable housing not considering that the land prices will go way up and not considering that we have no fundamental sidewalk network in the city of A ustin The strategic housing plan closely embraces the tenets of new urbanism Lots reduce parking and access to transit Research has shown that this does not produce affordable housing Only a small percentage of people who make the median income can aff ord housing developments on these principles Published in 2016 data for 152 new urbanist projects were obtained And it was found that 23 out of 152 developments only 15 were affordable to someone making the area median income And were not talking a bout people on the low income scale _ The last thing Ill say quickly is that Seattle implemented removing parking ten years ago Theyre building more apartments than ever And they have the hi ghest increase in the whole nation at 97 a year Thank you _ Thank you mayor and council My name is Alan Ive operated a small business on bur net road since 1984 I got interested in the Austin strategic housing plan because of its impact on my business I know others who have businesses on activity corridors I endorse the concept of affordable housing but I do not believe this plan delivers i t On the screen is a map I made of what this plan will do to Austin I took a half a mile red border around each of the activity corridors This represents a 3500 square foot lot with six units Theres actually denser development than this Take a look a t the activity of the corridor analysis I did which is next This gives you a layout of all of the activity corridors their length and the location north south east or west This if filled out with one mile wide activity corridors would create 51 million new units And according to the demographer in Austin that would allow us to put in 1247 million residents in Austin Texas I believe thats a little more than what we need at this time Im fairly stunned at the speed of this process the lack of data in it the lack of imagine austin required analysis and the fact the city is prepared to develop density one mile wide down each activity corridor I didnt even plot the centers This is tilted to the landowner who builds on the property nothing for those who make Austin home Small businesses pay a staggering amount of taxes yet we have four weeks to read and digest this document Based on current Seattle analysis that Ms Mcarthur referred to it appears that lower parking requirements will actually run families out Let me say that as a businessman I would never ever take this dramatic a change on the way I operate especially to business cust omers that I have This is a big mistake in my estimation It will hurt business in a way I cant comprehend  who my new customers are going to be as the patchwork quilt of redevelopment explodes Who are they what do they want at what price wheres t he traffic capacity to bring my customers in where are my parking spaces where are the families and will the flooding hit my business As a businessman I constantly need to know the law Changes to imagine Austin should be addressed through the annual review on page 220 Zoning decisions should be guided by imagine Austin page 220 Continued protection and preservation of existing neighborhoods to avoid endangering the character of the neighborhoods continued protection and preservation of existing ne ighborhoods page 219 One second Council there is none of this in the above document Affordable housing is a laudable goal but this document does not deliver it You cant build cheaper housing on expensive land If you want this done right please do not approve this document _ Hello My name is Mary and I live in district 7 Im also a board member for Ora which advocates for an Austin for everyone  Im here to testify in support of this plan Ive been very impressed with the staff engagement I actually got a presentation from them back in December because they provided a draft and were able to engage the community which I very much appreciate And I see how that draft has been updated based on a lot of community feedback so I really appreciate all the staff time that has gone into this document There are a few areas Id like to call out as particularly good that I think get lost in all the shu ffle And they should be maintained in any plan that does pass So in particular the focus on household affordability where you incorporate transit costs into peoples actual ability to afford a home is really really important The analysis supporting re ductions in parking is particularly beneficial as it directly affects rent paid by our lowest income residents We need to focus on housing people not cars especially as we talk about changes in autonomous vehicles and things like that And just because were removing parking minimums in certain areas doesnt mean that people wont continue to offer them to their residents and businesses Im especially in favor of the mention of allowing internal adus small lots which all provide more options to resid ents When I lived in Chicago where the standard lot size is 3000  about 3000 square feet I lived in a three flat home that the owner lived on the first floor another family lived on the floor above us and we had a shared back yard and it was wonde rful I could walk to the daycare to the bus to the transit stop the grocery store and I didnt need a car So it was way more affordable for me and it didnt have parking either So I also bicycle every day even now expecting at eig ht months I still take my children to school So Im encouraged to see that mention of connecting bicycle and sidewalk infrastructure to peoples housing choices So overall I support this plan And the only change I would add is to request that unit tar get be basically a lower threshold or to potentially even increase is because its a goal not a commitment And it doesnt account for many of the single persons who live with other people who have you know mentioned in various surveys that they would like to live alone if they could afford that But they currently cant And the growth numbers only look at current demand which were not even able to meet people at 100 mfi right now people who make median family income cannot afford a home in Austin So we need to address that And I thank you for your time today _ Good afternoon mayor mayor pro tem councilmembers I thank you forgiving me the opp ortunity to talk with you here today Im here in support of the strategic housing plan I will briefly talk about three things First as you all know the draft housing strategic plan is a two year process and it has involved a ten year community convers ation so we have had multiple opportunities for the community to chip in and give their feedback on this A plan that is From this process answers a lot of needs specified by the community and I think it is drastically better than what we have today which is nothing So having the plan and supporting it would be something we should do moving forward in keeping our affordability goals of the city Second I believe council should adopt the plan before we move to the codenext proce ss Codenext is a multi year projecten if you try to align that we will needlessly delay the plan which is not something we would potentially want As has been said the plan specifies our goals for the next ten years We need to specify the goals before w e move on to policy actions such as codenext to specify how will we act on those goals So we would want to support the plan before we go to the next process I just want to touch on this Theres been a lot of conversations surrounding having our housing stock 75 of our housing stock within a half mile of urban centers I do not own a car do not know how to drive do not talk to my mother about it The way I look at housing is where the bus goes It is important and Im so glad its a big part of this p lan so I definitely support that element Overall I ask you to vote in favor of the Austin teenager housing and plan  strategic housing plan and hope you will be able to do it today Thank you for this opportunity _ Hello My name is sakar Thomas and I am here in favor of the Austin strategic housing plan What I would like to do today is talk to you and Im here with the Austin board of realtors past chairman currently a real estate broker in Austin Ive been listing and selling property for a long time I would like for you to do a quick exercise in math so dont get afraid its really easy Write the number 48000 write that number down 48000 And then divide that by 12 Its 4000 The 4800 0 represents the average price that a teacher gets paid every year So if you divide that by 12 you get 12000 Multiple that by 30 thats 1200 That is currently the principal interest taxes and insurance would be for a etch tooer which would be great if we had houses that she could afford If the teacher wanted to buy a house in Austin that house would have to cost between 140 to 160 thousand dollars Right now sitting where we are apartments that cost more than that If you look right behind u s at ali downtown 201 lavaca one two bedroom rents for 1789 I cant afford that I go further 421 west third street one two bedroom 1689 I cant afford that What am I going to do Im going to drive to Buda like my daughters geometry teacher does and drive in every day because I cant afford a house in Austin Please pass the strategic housing plan Thank you very much _ Zenobia Joseph My handout is coming around I actually am in opposition to part of the plan as relates specifically to transit corridors Transit corridors are mentioned three times in the plan The word Corridors mentioned 20 times As a previous speaker mentioned it appears you did not plan in collaborat ion with capital metro transportation authority Let me just give you an example There are two reasons why you have public transportation One is for ridership the over coverage When you focus on ridership you are thinking bike a business you pick the people you want to serve When you are focus on coverage you are thinking about the needs of the people What I want you to recognize is much of what capital metro does is not transparent Heres a specific example Austin community college there is actu ally a stop in cedar park For the past three years capital metro has not charged cedar park for that stop So 27000 was just absent from their funding stream I often wonder why they kept the northwest feeder bus because it cost 2123 a rider While cu tting the routes where transit is needed in northeast and northwest Austin The routes that Im specifically talking about are where you have affordable housing Route 383 lake line bus and the route 392 off breaker line One of the things thats problemat ic they think like a business Route 214 they will receive money as relates to taxes from Lago vista voters They will receive money from jonestown I have no idea how much jonestown will owe them My point is they are focused on white people who are spec ifically millennials and I gave you that information on March 22 2017 72 white women ages 25 to 35 who earn over 100000 While you are talking about affordable housing anchor doors you have to recognize that the people that they focu s on are not the people who need transit the most I gave you some specific examples and I gave those to councilmember Ora Houstons office on April 24th 2017 One of the things thats problematic is what you are voting on a is an abstract map Thats a 3 0000 foot view Its not on the screen its in front of me though You can remove the map Its meaningless These are the corridors but they dont mean anything to the people looking at this plan Yet this is what you are voting for You can remove it One of the other recommendations that I have is what another person mentioned is aid In large part you have to recognize what the students need what the district needs and what the community needs as a whole and not vote on a plan tha t was done in abstract Thank you so much _ Mayor mayor pro tem councilmembers my name is sunshine Mathen Austin housing coalition and advocates in the city of Austin working to coordinate our collective work I was here to speak in support of the plan and Im here again The strategic housing plan is a critical core document directly relevant to a city that belongs to us all of us not just those who live here now and those of us that will soon have the leave the city for the same reason To be clear this document is one of a very very few that directly addresses in needs of the most vulnerable Transportation and afford ability We passed the transportation bond and now here is the next step to address the crisis of affordability I have heard criticism that it is not a plan because it lays out 60 plus strategies or methods for addressing affordability It is a plan becau se fundamentally we need them all There is no silver bullet to our crisis If there were we wouldnt need this document frankly We were confronted bye the beauty and strength of our city and intense market pressures and a state not sympathetic to munici pal policies We got what we got and we need all the strategies and that plan doiled out and implemented if we are going to succeed There is no  though no document of such a comprehensive nature is ever perfect for everyone I urge members of council to adopt the plan and further to take concerted focused action on the significant number of next steps to actualize the goals Thank you _ Rebecca director It is a part of Q and a Its part of the responses to the questions that were asked at work session We would be happy to make more copies _ Mayor mayor pro tem city council members members I spoke last week but I wanted to reiterate a couple of points Executive director of housing works Austin Housing works is also a member of Austin housing coalition which sunshine just spoke about A nd I wanted to let you know that we started this process I think it was about a decade ago if Im not mistaken I went through my files and I pulled a memo that we put together for prior city council March 2011 where we urged the city to develop a clear strategy for housing for housing across the income spectrum for the city and we laid out what we wanted to see in terms of goals and strategies to reach those goals So we are really thrilled that this is coming before you now And I do want to remind folk s that we had 18 plus months of public input that we were happy to be part of the stakeholder process and we really  there were multiple revisions The initial draft that came before city council the housing community development committee we provided a significant amount of input into that initial draft and we really felt like staff was responsive to our concerns with housing works Austin housing coalition and a lot of our recommendations were incorporated into the final draft before you So I really encourage you to adopt the strategic housing plan that is before you and make an amendment to the imagine Austin comprehensive plan because I feel like this is a really important guiding document and will help us get us where we want to be as a city Than k you _ Thank you mayor Councilmembers Charles Cloutman vice chair of the Austin housing coalition as well as vye president for home repair with meals on wheels and more or central Texas sorry old school We applaud the strategic housing plan We applaud the housing department for listening to input making this  the changes they could make and I am totally in favor of the plan as it stands bef ore you today The advocacy for 600 homes to be repaired annually is an eight year battle weve been waging for preservation of homeowner occupied housing So we dont lose the mom and pops of Austin They will keep our neighborhoods secure and we keep our neighborhoods in balance I also as current share of the building and standards commission as a private citizen Im saying this as a disclaimer to the legal department I am not representing the board but monthly we are confronted with failed multi fami ly rental housing and the in ability to do anything about it We must have a goal to preserve our apartments that are decaying We have more than 10000 units that are on the verge of decay as we speak We must have a safety net we must have an action pla n This is the beginning of that Its not the end We have many different strokes to wage this battle The mayors approach to this has been very heartening that we can come up with a public private partnership that will actually help our safety net We m ust move forward with this We will always Bain the day ten years from now if we dont act today We must move now I thank you all for taking this up I thank you for starting this process and I ask that you fulfill that for the citizens of this city and for the poor and for those who cant afford it We really appreciate it Thank you all _ Certainly Staff has submitted a summary of staff recommended changes that include a number of changes that were based on planning commission input as well as a few corrections and also input that we heard over the last  over the last few weeks at various  at various meetings Do you need me to read through them Its the document thats labeled staff recommended changes April 10th proposed Austin strategic housing plan _ It does And then we provided a clarification I guess a document that was distributed today and it just pulls out there e xactly whats in the staff recommended changes It just shows how the staff recommended changes were responsive to the planning commission recommendations _ Thank you very much Ryan Robinson city demographer Mayor mayor pro tem city manager Im feeling kind of lonely philosophically out here I feel like Ive been made out to be a sprawl agent or sprawl merchant That was not my intent And you know hearing the people in this room who I really respect and not to call her out but Mandy Demayo I dont ever want to be on the arguing side of Mandy And housing is one of those complicated sort of unverses into itsel f But my basic intent is simply to point out that what were trying to do with this plan and its an admirable plan is reverse really big market forces I would love to see that happen I would love to see the city of Austin retake that market share In this case market share is population But Im just not sure that we have the tools I want to be a believer that we can create market rate housing that we can generate that in the right part of town But Im just not sure how we do that One reason why I dont understand that is Im not a housing person The part that I know a little bit about are big broad population trends And what were talking about is really stepping in and taking this fabulous city of ours and really moving it not just nudging it or taking advantage of opportunities where we see them but Im just worried that were fighting windmills That were going to put ourselves in a position thats overly aspirational To me the word Strategic I harrisonly immaterial please achievable go als If we set goals its a goal its really ambitious and that grates and we should have ambitious goals but we need to be cognizant of when we become pollyannaish and when were setting something within the realm I think there are things we can do My intent is to not under mine this plan I think its a great plan The team its a great team We have lots of smart people in this room I dont want to intercede with that process I want to come inen a say you guys are talking about m oving a mountain If thats what we want to do then lets get to it But thats going to be  I just want us to be fully cognizant The one quick followup the reason I fear overhe had asking units  overscheduling units somebody said it earlier you have to have a state of oversupply The market is probably not going to let that state of oversupply ever happen The development community at least on the multi family side they are so sensitive to occupancy That when citywide occupancy kicks down one point two points they throw the brakes on big time As long as were all sort of on board thats what were up against that was my intent of the memo And it hurts to be thought of as sort of someone who is promoting sprawl thats not what I want to do  I want to see this city be you know the extremely successful place that we are But our housing is expensive because we are successful We have been the most vibrant metropolitan economy in the country for six years running So its a cookie cutter Ou r city boundary is a cookie cutter you are putting on this expanding piece of dough  I dont know if that analogy works There are strategies we can do but I just want us to stay within the realm of whats achievable and yet be ambitious _ You know and maybe thats already outside the realm of my expertise and I want to be sensitive to that because if any expertise I have is focused on the demographics I just think that from 27 years working for the city and following these markets the devel opment community doesnt want to create an oversupply We had a big oversupply in the 80 Forsyth those of us here It took a long time to work through that That was good old fashioned speculative building Was it good bad It has wound up giving us clus ters of affordable housing We benefited from that oversupply but it took us 20 years to get that benefit I want to believe we can influence the market but you know thats where I just  you know especially in a strong property rights environment and especially in a state that relies on property tax I just think its going to be a hard needle to move It doesnt mean we shouldnt get out there and try sue that was the intent Also I want to say when one of you reaches out to staff thats our job is to respond So I feel like Im you know that I did that I responded but now you know I  it seems like I wish that this was an environment where we could share our professional opinions with a little bit more ease than what it seems like were able to do now _ My p rofessional opinion is that there really are no best practices In my opinion no city out there has figured this out Show me a vibrant city with a vibrant healthy economy that doesnt have really expensive housing I havent seen that Am erican city _ Part of that is my own fault I did work with them and its  my day to day is just so busy and frenetic I should have reached back out My manager Matt thats something weve kicked around Thats culpability on our side I dont want to say there was a low level collaboration because t hats on us I would like to see city departments do more expensive cross departmental work And I think we could always do that better _ Correct And I dont want to say its outside the realm of possible to move this needle I guess I just  to me when I thought about my response to the plan that was kind of big thing I wanted to point out is its assuming a sea c hange in market forces that I think are maybe outside what we can influence _ Thats where the math would take me and thats where I would say let s be more  this is where I want to call on people who know a whole lot more about this than I do my fear we would accelerate the move of our organic older stock Thats a discussion youve had Youve kicked that around in work session Theres some s pecific math to it So thats just my general concern And I think you guys are past where I am on that general concern because you guys have heard that before When I worry about unintended consequences when I think to me that is more than what the marke t would normally give us Again we can move that we can change that My fear is we would accelerate the removal of our precious older organic stock I could be wrong about that _ To the point my d irector Guernsey helped me with that Ten years is a goal maybe it takes us 15 years to get there and Im not suggesting we change that but remember you know mayor Wynns goal of 25000 people by 015 We knew we wouldnt make it but were on on way M aybe as a numbers guy I get a little caught up in do we really expect to have that in ten years and thats the intent of my memo I dont want to say its impossible but it would really be a sea change in our affecting regional market trends _ I had a huddle with the housing team and I think more so than I may have realized in my initial assessment they are also big believers in the preservation of the older stock But I would think maybe thats one of our hyper monitor points is that lets just be really really vigilant that we dont let that slip away So we roll that into some kind of monitoring aspect to the plan I dont know But that  been here since 1959 Thats one of my fears since were talking about how long weve been here _ I agree with that I did not mean to suggest we dont put a lot of time and making it too binary but if we do that only after we have done everything we can to preserve the organic older stock Not one or the other but maybe a little  you know but mo re attention to the preservation than new stock _ When I look around t he country for best practice I look at the countrys biggest city New York City has got incredible levels of income differential but it works And it works because you can get on transit and its the great leveling agent Ive got a kid in Brooklyn who works in Manhattan These three blocks from a subway line I think we can mitigate this notion of housing differential across metropolitan space but the only thing that really works is the ability to get that mobility as part of it Were certainly stepping our way with a mobility bond but its got to be outside the city I go back to this notion were just a cookie cutter in this ever expanding piece of dough I add that because to me that is the only thing at the end of the day that real ly solves it is recaps it regional transit because you cant really have everyone on the same point residentially _ I would agree with that And somebody mentioned campo and capcog Since Im up here Ill take the chance We have to bring those two entities to go Npos and cogs belong in the same organization Thats the north central Texas model and thats one thing keeping us from achieving more successful regional transportation outcomes _ Yes sir Good afternoon mayor and council My name is Tony Arnold project manager with parks and recreation department Were here today to offer information on the zilker metropolitan parks proposed Barton creek greenbelt After this presentation which will be short we would be asking to grant a variance to allow for a site exemption for impervious cover limits and control to allow us to build this Ada accessible restroom and other facilities in the critical water quality zone _ Yes maam Rosie truelove the applicant has asked the item be postponed to the may 4 council meeting _ Good afternoon mayor and council David cull gan with economic development As you recall we had information last week where we provided more information about potential agreement with Merck corporation Staff is here today although we have provided quite a few of your answers for some of the questions that were provided last week We can review any of the information or we can answer any additional questi ons you may have this week We have members from the community and for the company that is present for the company today as well _ A change after speaking with the company regarding your request to include language and the agreeme nt that would help to memorialize some of the community impact goals and what it is that the company described during their time with you and through the business information form that spoke to more of the community related projects in terms of public heal th as well as workforce development _ Were requiring a report on an annual basis The report is for city use to better understand the community and how it is engaging in this project _ The company is not able to incorporate that into their agreement They will be leasing space They will be looking to make agreements on the two locations But not having a central location yet they did not feel comfortable making that agreement _ I want to thank our staff as well as members of Merck for including the information that captures what we discussed in terms of the community partnership I think thiss very important I think that reporting t hat on an annual basis will help our community understand how those partnerships are working and so I appreciate the staff putting that into our agreement Thank you _ Gus Pena native austinite east fifth street Our former neighborhood is full of apartments I want to make a note that land and engineer has retired already told me its still contaminated So when we do thing when we approve things make sure the land usage is clean not contaminated I wanted to say about M erck and I went a little bit off tangent If this passes and the reason I will support it in part is because what will it bring to the city of Austin What will it bring to the coffers What will it bring to an environment that really is no t vibrant for the poor the have notes job economic development thats important to me to the community I may not be here next week Im an old  Im a Marine Corps veteran If I leave I will  Ive been here 64  65 years now And I just want for the kids to have the best opportunity they could have and a vibrant community a environment that is clean for them When I was growing up And something economically safe for my children My grand kids my nieces and nephews My baby Sophie 2 12 month s old I want something good for her You met my baby Sophie I brought her over here anointed in front of the council I think of that councilmember Garza because you have a new child also and children and for my baby Sophie I want the best for her A nd I know my friends will disagree with me and they wont be supportive of me I hope they will But I hope this is a good economic development Im going to support it I  I trust Mike Rawlings Ive known him for many years Hes never told me a lie E xcept that I lost a lot of weight No man Im still heavy But I want to let yall know I thought about it and I struggled Were going to support it I know some of my friends that know But lets get the best bang for the buck buck fo r the bang whatever it is You know And let it be a benefit for Austin Im leaving it at that You vote whatever you want to vote your conscious Yall are intelligent Mr Casar is more intelligence than I am Do it for the best interest for the city o f Austin and Im going to look back through the housing We need more housing if were going bring more company employees Thank you very much _ My name is Chri stopher Rios Ive been a long time resident in Austin Texas Pleasure to speak with you all Speaking here on what have of the greater Austin hispanic chamber of commerce Im chair elected of the hispanic chamber We fully endorse this proposal to bring an institution and company as prestigious as Merck to our Austin family and community We believe in the creation of the Dell medical school in 2012 Travis county voters approved funding to bring innovative game changers to this community Its good for economic development its good for opportunities for our youth A sizable amount of these jobs will be available to individuals with two year college degrees This is great opportunity for the youth and the ACC campuses with that I fully hope that the co uncil supports this to ensure that we are bringing and attracting positive game changers to innovate in our health care delivery Because a healthy delivery is a prosperous community And with that I will log the rest of my time Thank you very much _ Mayor Im Bob Bowen temple shalom and a board member of capital idea The position of Austin interface with re gards to taxing incentives is clear Its working out the details of the citys economic incentive policy several years ago The position is consistent If any company wants to locate and relocate in Austin seeks incentive they must comply in certain requ irements Among the living wages is defined by agreement of regular and contract employees and the web compliance and insurance benefits for all of the employees safety training workmans compensation insurance Thats all covered We are disappointed th at the local hiring goals for Merck employees are not a part of the application We recognize though that Austin needs a greater supply of skilled technical workers Capital idea has successfully increased the supply of skilled technical workers but man y more are needed to meet local demand We encourage Merck to work with capital idea to ensure an adequate supply of trained employees to meet the community needs Beyond the formal commitment to full time jobs contained in the 3 a agreement and the other investments committed Merck has indicated to me they need to contract for many additional jobs And hear from the rules for contracted employees The contractedobs range from service to administrative construction and technical Austin wil l appreciate the opportunity to work with Merck to make sure the jobs are locally and represent the diversity of Austin On behalf of Austin interfaith and the 36 member institutions representing thousands of families in Austin we thank you for this oppor tunity to address the council Thank you _ Good afternoon council Thank you for the opportunity to be here Im bill rice Im the senior vice president of clinical innovation at St Davids health care the largest provider in centr al Texas Im the former chair and current board member for the cancer intervention and research institute of Texas which is the second largest cancer research funding organization in the United States All of the funding goes to Texas Im also a chair of a new organization called the Austin health care council which is an organization that is formed and intended to bring together siloed organizations and entities under a single platform to address community needs So I mention those three things because i n my professional life Im a physician by training I have the opportunity to think deeply about molecules and cells at the level of cancer Of organs and human beings in the systems of care in St Davids and underserved safety net and community as I thi nk about the things that I work on in the Austin health care council And coincidentally when I think about the most important things to accelerate progress at all three of the levels its digital health Its the opportunity to computati onally model different entities different organ systems whatnot Its the opportunity to use computational modelling to create the predictors of adverse outcomes and its in the  its the opportunity to use computational modelling and digital health to provide better care across the spectrum So I wanted to say that I support the motion before you because we think that the fastest way to celebrate progress in clinical medicine and all three of the levels the most  the fastest way to impact care and t hose who have the most need those that are part of the safety net certainly those with chronic disease through care systems community health and certainly cancer all of those are most accelerated the progress knows are most accelerated with digital he alth and computational modelling So we encourage you to support the motion before you on the basis of that I guess I finish with you know theres a certain harmony with the digital health initiative with the technology community in Austin You know tha t certainly the ai space here in Austin is emerging hot spot and you know all of these things you talked about are directly or indirectly to the ai Thank you for the opportunity to be here _ Dr Rice thank you Thank you for taking public testimony on this I wish I could come here cheerleading this deal the way everyone else seems to testify on it is But I dont think theres any way to describe this deal as anything short of disgraceful Let me give you one number that sums up everything you need to know about this deal 171 billion That is Mercks current market cap As a point of comparison I looked it up this morning Thats the equivalent of the gdp of New Zealand This is who were going to give a tax break to Now the innov ation zone at the Dell medical school sounds like a lovely idea and I think that good things can come of it But I also think that when the market cap of 171 billion Merck can pay for it themselves Think about the homeowners think about the person tryi ng to start a business in their  in their living room Think about the person selling stuff on E tsy why should that person barely making ends meet have to subsidize the development thats going to happen either way with a company thats going to make  that is currently worth 171 billion I dont see any  now you say this is going to create jobs You say its good for innovation These figures when ever these deals come up always get bantied about and they never come back nearly what they claim t heyre going to be So I can count votes I think I know the way this is going But at the same time I dont think this is a good use of public resources And if we are going to go ahead and pass this deal I really dont want to hear anyone on this counc il ever again complain that we may be looking at a budget cut for something in the future So thank you for taking your time for listening to me Thats what I have to say _ I want to add my voice to those who have spoken f or this They agreed on something Just hope they do for this one _ Thank you honorable council people Its an organization I represent Im executive director We provide science technology engineering science and math programs for girls Some of you may be aware of our work If so Im grateful We were founded nearly 20 years ago in Austin Since that time weve developed nationally recognized out of school pr ograms such as girls start after school and summer camp for the year round programs for girls The chief commitment is to provide support and preserve girls in central Texas but you may wish to be aware were reply kalting across Texas and nationally Wer e able to sustain and scale our work because people view what we do as central to their interest and nurture and diverse and rich work voice Were grateful for a dedicated group of individuals foundations and government entities like nasa its corporat ions who understand the role the most Its companies like Merck that place diversity among the core values that particularly exciting for us at girl start 100 of girls are underserved in STEM 80 plus of girl start after schoolgirls come from a nonw hite or low socioeconomic house hold And for us hearing the core value diversity Merck has clearly made is very exciting for us STEM Careers provide a huge opportunity not just for girls but for girls and future families since 60 of US House holds have a woman as sole or co breadwinner We have the opportunity to meet with the associate vice president and mark Sylvester of Merck recently And we were very excited Its evident to us that they have a strong commitment to the same goals that we share  I think its worth noting that they have an ambitious yet achievable set of goals for diversity Seeking to have 50 of your STEM Workforce be female is really notable What weve also noticed from our own research is thats achievable with regard to Merck with their innovation hubs and workforce generally they have accomplished a great deal of d iversity particularly with regard to women not just in marketing hr or but in true STEM Jobs Were excited because if Merck will come to Austin girl start girls will have a great option when considering what to study and where to work and perceive Austin as a place to stay rather than leave after secondary or college We know girls have great ideas and helping people is a huge inspiration to many of them Biotech innovative health advancements fit squarely in that area We know there are many reas ons why Merck opening an innovation hub in the here and now with regard to the support that you heard for the medical community the medical school and health generally But we know a company like Merck in Austin will open doors as well as open futures S o we at girlstart encourage you to do what you can to bring this national important leader to Austin Thank you _ Im not sure this is a question for Mr Culligan or the company Since weve been discussing Merck and the company name became public a lot of people approached me about how to get involved getting forward as nonprofit partners or as con tractors or as applicants Im just wondering if someone could let people know who to contact if theyre interested in being involved should we proceed with a positive vote and they decide to come here _ Ive been told that person is in t he room today Amy herrick is actually the lead for hr for technical recruits out of Merck So if they do choose to be here should it be the representative that would look to connect the individuals to _ I dont recall taking that second vote Two questions  first one  there they are The second item about family friendly housing about the very end of the change paragraph it adds the phrase support under the old schools My concern with adding that phrase one is the crossing of the streams between the citys jobs and t he school districts job But also this would necessarily put housing in one part of it And we are trying to get housing in all parts of town that would mean put housing where schools are either at a level of enrollment or a high level of enrollment So my concern with this phrase is that it necessarily directs staff or directs this plan to housing in only certain parts of town And I think the reason those schools are underenrolled is not about the amount of family friendly housing that surrounds thos e schools So its half policy and half question _ Youre looking at the planning commission Does it say Is this the planning commission So it would be  _ Its that reco mmendation  so that was a recommendation that was added Basically in response to a planning commission a planning commission recommendation and the general idea was to  was to help provide more family friendly housing near enrolled schools But you ar e correct in your assessment _ Right so if we include in the housing plan th at we should be building family friendly housing and targeting areas around enrolled schools my first concern is that it creates a situation where we are trying to plan around the school districts plan _ And we dont have a voice in their facile the is plan So its one job and the other job But more importantly I dont think the lack or the presence of family friendly housing in underenrolled schools is the reason theyre underenrolled nor will the construction of that housing solv e the enrollment concerns I dont think the housing is why the schools are losing kids _ Im fine with moving on The fact that this says This could provide is sufficiently less prescriptive But I did want to daylight that more so for that And then Im going to take a pause to make sure that my notes are in conflict or not in conflict _ And for me its as much about discouraging housing in areas that have schools that are at capacity which is nearly every school in my district But I still need to do  my district still needs to do its part in building housing So I think that the recommendation that we should be doing to help with underenrollment also wor ks the other direction that we would not build that housing in areas that dont have  Im willing to move on My other note is on  its two sections that seem in conflict And I want to clarify On page 16 change And I think they alter one of the ame ndments which solves the conflict but I wanted staff to solve the conflict Page 16 25 of new income and restrictive housing should be in high income areas Page 22 to 24 says 25 to moderate to high areas So Im curious if opportunity area high and m oderate is a defined thin thats on a map somewhere or is it just a description _ It is something thats on a map thats often used locally thats called an opportunity map and it does have different  it does define areas of moderate  moderately hig h opportunity high opportunity mismatch that you state was a staffing error So I think that they should match But those are maps that actually should be updated and we are looking at potentially updating those or creating some newer opportunity maps bas ed on metrics that are important in our community _ Well we discussed both which is obviously why they dont match But were comfortable with high opportunity _ I want to clarify thats councilmember Pooles amendment that youre referencing that I think councilmember tovo may be making the motions for _ I wanted to clarify something though I heard the staff say you are comfortable with it Do you recommend that or do you recommend  which  sometimes I hear folks say theyre comfortable but that may not be the recommendation _ We would like them to match and align We are recommending moderate and high Correct One of the things that this is  this is an important point One of the things that we want to stress is that when were looking at where housing should be placed we are also looking at areas where we could see gentrification The policy would be to add that metric to look at that _ So that criteria is one of the criteria that we use for scoring in our rental hous ing program And do we want to probably get a printout of that map to show exactly how limiting it is when you go from moderate and high to just high we understand that the purpose of the planning commission motion was to ensure that  that actually havi ng the goal near transit did not rule out also having a place where there wasnt as good a transit access So if  if council is willing we can probably have somebody pull up that map And we could come back to that specific question _ I would like to confer with staff for a couple of minutes on that so we can move forward and come back with an aligned recommendation so Im taking all of the factors in to consideration What I will say is it has been brought forwar d over time that the moderate opportunity area is one that we need to very strategically look at because of the potential gentrification issues So _ I believe council Nebraska kitchen and I are moving forward Councilmember Poole drafted amendments and is unable  shes not here today shes out on city business That is one  I think Ill leave that one for now and wait for the staff to come back Well pick it up in a bit Maybe I could take up my other one which is maybe  _ Its not one that we can report I think whats been presented to us is comparable to the other plans that we have adopted that are part of the imagine Austin And I dont want to change the name precisely because I dont want to change the impression that it s a plan Because I believe it is a plan I believe it is one that its important to start working on So  _ I move to amend the strategic plan under the maximize affordable housing to additional language The city should consider developing a strategy to purchase state owned lands as they come up for sale for desirable and aff ordable locations that include income and strict housing and parkland _ Yes I move to change under the better land for affordable housing adding additional language the city should continue to offer density bonuses as well as reduced parking and lot and setback requirements for the development that includes the significant number of units required to be low and middle income housing for a minimum of 40 years Tovo and kersee had additional percentage Correct me councilwoman tovo you agreed that number was preferable _ Just the question about the definition of Significant We have programs that some might interpret significant to mean 50 And theres no progr am that gets you 50 So thats my hesitation with  with saying significant or even significant percentage because I dont know how that word is defined And it took  have staff question _ So the citys current vertical mixed use density bonus prog ram which I say one of the most effective has a requirement of 10 of the affordable care act mostly 60 _ For me thats my guiding principle as I go through the amendments Im comfortable with significant at this point Recognizing theres an implementation plan It could well be that the implementation plan has set specific goals or we go code next We could come back and add specificity to this document So at this point in giving an aspirational goal to staff to come up with the number significant which I would expect them to use that in the context of aspirational and achievable taking all of those things into account were looking for something here that would be significant Im fine with that language Mr Casar _ Ill be happy to jump in on councilmember pools for starters She did propose striking moderate and I know staff have conferred and it was my under standing that there was some support for that striking but if we would just provide some clarification on that _ So we did take another look at the map and based on that we would feel more comfortable with having both of those actually be moderate a nd high opportunities to make sure that we are able to captu areas that are either you know gentrifying or are great opportunities where our low income housing tax credits can be leveraged and those are very  the qualified application program for those are very specific and so occasionally it will be important for the city to have flexibility to be able to leverage those funds _ That ha T is a concern That there would be areas that would fall outside the high opportunity areas _ I just want to ask did I want to add a little bit more comment to this because where we see the metrics and the current methodology is really where that moderatehigh can move I would just like to say publi cly part of the implementation plan which is actually pretty helpful is that we will be looking at a pretty robust stakeholder process in which we get a modernized metric system around this which currently right now for example does not include metri cs that foresee or forecast gentrification in this map So where we see movement is around metrics for example around education food you know health metrics Those kinds of things And so for us right now where the mapping is we know it needs to be updated and I think that that is a conversation were got want to have with not just the council committee but with you all certainly in the future but providing some flexibility around moderate and high would be helpful right now for the as operational  more visionary document And an implementation if this is something that council would like us to come back and tee up and bring more data around I think thats something that were going to be doing anyway _ We can take this up We could certainly provide some data that we fee l comfortable you all would have something to inform the decision further _ Yes So this was  this was actually an amendment that planning commission recommended was to have a unit mix goal and so it was based on the table on page  Ill find the page in a minute but basically there was a forecast of the number of un its needed in each  in each unit type and it was projected out to 20 2040 We did analysis to break that down to a ten year goal about broke down the housing types and which ones fit into generally this taking range between small singl efamily up to eight plex This is very rough but estimated it would be approximately 30 of the expected demand over the next 30 years _ We feel comfortable with the second part of the amendment We dont really have  we have not researched the  whats being  we dont have enough research to know whether we would support the first part So I guess  therefore were not comfortable supporting the first bullet because we dont feel like we have enough information _ Im assistant city attorney Outside of zoning Im not sure when it talks about exploring options what options they would be exploring All I can say is as they explore those options we would be involved with them to make sure anything that came forward as an action would in fact be within our authority to do it _ Sure I think that  I think what we can say is language around per industry standards and you know  and planning research I believe that youre correct that would definitely be I think what we would want to point to and what likely councilmembe r pool would point to and we would certainly cite that So I think we could definitely add language per  per you know research and industry standards we would set the goal _ Mayor Adler : See I would expect them as they develop it and explore to take into account that research without them having studied the research Im uncomfortable picking out a study It may very well be exactly right and I think that is whats driving councilme mber pool I just think its already incorporated in the work that our staff would do especially given fact that theyre asked to create age diverse neighborhoods So I think the criteria is inherent in the sentence that councilmember pool wrote Councilm ember alter _ She did And we just havent had a chance to look at those studies so I mean I believe that they exist but we havent looked at them and wed like to take a look I think the other question is how do you define Neighborhood so that would be something for an implementation plan to try and figure out how one might do that _ I dont believe we recommend decoupling in the plan anywhere though it has been discussed in different places _ In the university neighborhood overlay parking is decoupled as part of rent And so Ive personally experienced that with my daughter where she paid for her own parking and I paid for her rent for a year _ I would recommend that we stay with councilmember pools amendment and the reason for that is we have pulled the data in high and moderate Currently we are at 25 So with that we would recommend the goal be high and recognizing that implementing the plan we will be bringing back to you all more information on the opportunity mapping _ In the morning light all those new things you do coming into focus coming into focus in your head the sun across your face makes you look like a gold boy _ The belle soundscom Thats b elle soundsc om and connects to all the rest of the various social media that we are on _ They can  I dont know if its at Waterloo I should check on that They can g o to the website and order it online download it or order a physical copy Or come to one of our shows and get one there _ You should come on Saturday Were playing the Saxon purr right before ray Primm who you had not long ago Were doing a double bill we that would be great So we have a proclamation Be it whereas the city of Austin Texas is

councilmember Casar for your enduring support of survivors as we work to make the system more responsive and more justice for the two in five women and one in five men who are survivors of sexual assault I want to first of all  theres be en a lot of press lately about the backlog and as we work to do that I want survivors to know that if you have one of the kits and wants to know whats happening with your kit in a cold case you can call 512 974 5555 and someone from APD will be in touch with you about whats happening with your case We spend a lot of time on the start and rightfully so talking about whats wrong with the system and how to fix it but I want to take the opportunity to say what is right And here in Austin were very lucky to have very knowledgeable and passionate advocates and nurses who respond after a sexual assault and were blessed with a fantastic victim service counseling team at APD So I want to recognize them and the hard work that you do on behalf of survivors ev ery single day because as councilmember Casar said this is an issue that affects our community every single minute of every single day not just during the month of April So thank you so much and we look forward to working with you on future initiatives _ Good evening Im Delia Garza Im the city councilmember that represents district 2 which is southeast Austin Im often very proud  Im always very proud of all the work that we do here on council even the things that I may disagr ee with I know that my colleagues are working hard and doing their best to pass good policy Theres one item connected to this proclamation for autism month that I am particularly proud of because I was approached actually before I was even sworn in on my first term I was approached by a parent Jackie benestante and she told me how the city did not cover health coverage that was therapy that greatly helped children with autism and they said the city should be providing that for their employees So we me t with her and other members of the autism community and we were able to pass the policy that requires the city to cover those benefits So its special to me because it was one of my first acts as a councilmember and it really has helped so many of our Au stin  our city of Austin family So Im proud to read this proclamation be it known that whereas the autism society of Texas has provided meaningful assistance to thousands of individuals with autism for 27 years Ones of families  hundreds of familie s have received support in the form of advocacy recreation activities and support groups and whereas the autism society of Texas spreads awareness about autism Autism is the fastest growing developmental disability The incidence of autism has increased in recent years to an approximate occurrence of one in 68 births nearly twice as great as the 2004 great of 1 in 25 And almost one in 42 boys People in autism typically have severe difficulties with communication behavior and social relationships And whereas the autism society of Texas promotes autism acceptance and awareness of individuals with autism and their families year round and would like to highlight autism awareness in the month of April Now therefore I Delia Garza on beha lf of mayor Steve Adler of the city of Austin and the rest of the council do hereby proclaim April 2017 as autism awareness month  _ Thank you mayor In honor of move more in April month the American heart association wants to thank you and city council for this proclamation We know that regular physical activity and safe places to be active improve heart health and reduce cardiovascular risks and so were very appreciati ve of the opportunities for austinites to be healthy for good Thank you  _ Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking I just want to say thank you to the city to the city council to the city staff senior management of the city You know I came to Austin in 1970 to come to school here Fell in love with the ci ty right away Ive moved away and moved back a couple of times but Austins always been you know the shining light on the hill in my view of the world Its been an incredible opportunity to work for the city the last close to 17 years Mayor Im sure youre aware you have an incredible staff And I particularly want to call out the transportation department staff I think over the last eight years weve been able to build a team that you would have to look pretty hard to find a team that would exceed the abilities and the accomplishments of our staff So reluctantly you know when I came here I had a full head of hair  My dream was to you know grow it long and have a ponytail  Thats not going to happen it looks like La ughter So I think theres great things coming forward with the mobility bond to build a better Austin I will be involved as  with helping my friends to move things forward and again thank you for this opportunity and the opportunities Ive had over the last 16 years Rob spillar has been a great friend Robert Goode has been a great assistant city manager that has really helped us to see the vision and make it happen So thank you  _ Mayor on the last line if I could say that the city should continue to submit to fair housing laws _ Lastly allow the development of smaller houses on smaller lot S I have inserted the word Vacant I have inserted the word Maybe more likely to be affordable small lot renovations co uld be revised to be a little less descriptive and also open up just to really be clear that they are not always more affordable and then the last line adds and maybe we should take these up separately as well unless theres support just to add them to the resolution which would be great Such regulations should take care not to incentivize the demolition of existing housing stock and I would say this in many ways gets back to the discussion that we had earlier with our demographer where he talked about the unintended consequence some of which is we can adopt things This is my words not his but we can adopt certain provisions and code that actually intendcy vice the exdemolition of existing housing stock I dont think that should be our goal I think we should be careful of that We sho uld take care not to incentivize the demolition of existing housing stock _ On this one I actually  unlike the other ones where I clearly wasnt fighting too hard this one I created a substitut e amendment to that I think addresses many of mayor pro tems concerns But  and I think addresses mine as well and we can discuss it if I get a second Its on this Orange piece of paper _ The difference be tween my amendments and mayor pro tems are I removed the word Smaller vacant lots I think were not just talking about  I would not like to talk about smaller houses on smaller vacant lots I think theres the opportunity on homes that are going to be demolished for  on places where its formally commercial development or parking to have smaller homes on smaller amounts of space Second I have changed to say this would help produce more housing choices that are generally more likely to be more aff ordable than houses built on larger lots as opposed to may be more likely I think that its  its pretty clear that requiring a house to be on a larger lot has an overall negative affordability effect My  what my statement  the rea son I included the word generally is to get to your point that there are case of course where a small expensive house can be on a small expensive lot and you can have a cheap small house on a cheap big lot Those things do exist and I think that should b e acknowledged but I think that we dont want to unintentionally say that it might potentially be and we should research whether or not big lots in expensive areas of land will be more expensive than smaller pieces of land I think its generally true th at a smaller piece of land compared to a bigger piece of land is going to be less expensive I think thats just the case and I dont know of anybody arguing on the city staff or on the dais that mandating a larger lot is going to be cheaper And finally t he last considerable difference instead of saying such regulation should take care not to incentivize the demolition of such housing stock I change that to such demolition should incentivize more housing choices rather than viewer I think the point of thi s were trying to create affordable choices and more affordable housing across the range of incomes Were not committed to not doing anything that might result in a demolition loss theres going to be demolition and I think our goal is to preserve affor dable housing stock _ I dont think anybody is disagreeing with that Im certainly not disagreeing with that I just simply think that inserting Vacant is too narrow while it is true smaller houses on smaller lots do not necessarily equal affordability they can sometimes depending on where they are and all of the other circumstance so Im not comfortable with inserting Vacant I do prefer your last sentence to councilman Casars so maybe we can take these separately _ I think there were three against It was alter mayor pro tem and Flannigan That takes us to the last changes we havent discussed Apparently is that what the change could be to generally Are generally more likely _ Same thing as we had before So in the next paragraph still under small lots could bibiing changed to generally Those in favor of generally please raise your hands Flannigan Those opposed it is alt er Houston and mayor pro tem Others voting aye that change is also made Pool off the dais Okay Now we have to vote on the mayor pro tems  _ I can promise that Okay Item 36 is case 340120 Austin oaks put for the property located at 3429 3435 3526 36 37 3724 and 3737 executive center drive Executive center drive and 3601 7719 this is a request to zone it pud This is third reading of the case Im not going to do the staff presenta tion I think you heard it a couple of times but I want to offer up amendments staff would recommend before we start getting into the the council amendments The petition was valid this morning at  I think it was 24 something percent This morning we had one signature taken off and a couple signatures added on and as of right now the petition is not valid at 1983 percent except a few moments ago I was handed a letter with a signature from a gentleman named Larry slater representing into properties L P hes responsible for 46 percent of the petition so taking his name off its 141 so the petition is not valid at this time I also have amendments staff would like to offer up _ Okay The first addresses the issue of the use of the first floor of the additional  or off the residential portions of the property Staff would like to see some requirement for commercial uses on that first floor and the ordinance as it currently states is rather vague as to what amount of commercial uses there would be So staff would like to offer up the following amendment that on part 5a to add a requirement for 2500 square feet of commercial use At least 2500 square feet of commercial use on the ground floor of multi family residential  and mu lti family residential above the ground floor so basically on the two buildings would require 2500 square feet of commercial space on each one and the applicant is in agreement with that amendment _ Sure The language would be  mixed use development is required on parcels 8 and 9 with 2500 square feet of commercial use on the ground floor and multi residential use on the ground floor _ So the applicant is asking us for additional height May I know which community benefits hes giving us in return _ I guess you have to ask the applicant on that Staff position is we feel for three feet of additional height does not get him an extra floor its just to accommodate technical requirement has to do with the height of the truck in the loading lock So this is rather just a requirement of the physical building _ I  Im a little surprised that this is coming up now when this has been known about for a very long time _ The other part has to do with the transportation issue and the council member pool when she was here last time offered an amendment to include even though its included in the restrictive covenant to include the trip c ap in the ordinance At the time the number being discussed was 19648 trips if you may remember I said we should call those unadjusted trips because I didnt want them to be able to double count adjusted and unadjusted and get a higher number Turns out we were mistaken Pre proposed language to say site planner for the property may not be approved or ush eyed If acumulative  or traffic that exsides 15562 adjusted trips per day A request to change the 15562 adjusted trips per day requires approval by council I like to add words before that new trips per day so what this is the traffic generated by the jemt is proposed to be us using rough numbers 16000 theres a 1000 adjustment for internal capture Theres 4000 trips on th e property a day The 19000 is the total in the tia However I would like to include adjusted in there so it is clear thats the number that should be used It is not adding more traffic just clarifying the tia memo and the final part has to do with parki ng and there was some discussion earlier about the parking proposed by the applicant There is an announce in this case for a reduction in the parking and urban core and the part that refers to the change in the parking we think should refer to parking req uirements and urban core reductions We add 2672a and its just a code reference issue doesnt change the numbers _ I had a question on the transportation Did I hear you say you were going to add some additional language to whats up on the screen I may not have heard you correct limit _ Yes I would like to say where it says 15000 adjusted trips per day I wou ld like it to stay 15562 new adjusted trips per day _ Theres a credit given for the 4000 trips that already exist on the site per day So the total trips stated to me 19000 that we stated last time The transportat ion department would like to refer to it as 15562 new trips and if you look at tia you see theres already 4000 trips in there already existing _ It is setting a cap The difference is theres already 4000 trips today The new development would add 15000 tr ips to that for a total of 19000 This is stating in the ordinance repeating what is in the restrictive cover fence saying theres 15000 new trips and I have transportation it info if you want to do that _ When you measure it after the development an d were determining what the cap is what your measurement at that time should be you are saying it should be 15562 plus the existing 4000 right _ Yes Throughout the tia we reference the adjusted trips or new trips throughout Part of our desires is to be consistent with that This gives applicant more leeway and allow that cap to increase It just maintains consistency throughout When the original of 1900 or so trips were discussed that came from the dais We might have read the wrong number It s 19000 and change close to 20000 Thats not changed but the number that were confident in and we used throughout the tia is the adjusted number at 15000 _ So last question then so for purposes of being able to evaluate what is happening on th e site are you saying its not necessary to actually put the total cap Because when you go out there are you going to have to measure and then back into it Because that number is not actually the cap _ Right But we know how many trips are being cr eated today So we can compare the news to what we see today Eric would you like to  _ To what you see today not at the time that you measure it right Im just thinking that it might be clear that if you use both term so its 150 00 adjusted not to exceed a total cap of the total amount I mean Im just concerned about what happens seven eight nine ten years from now There may be some confusion what the total cap may be Does that make sense what Im asking _ The reason we preferred the 15000 number like Mr Spiller said was all of the analysis all of the impacts to the network over the mitigation associated with the impacts are based on the 15000 number U _ I think what were trying to say shall not exceed 15562 n et new trips Were trying to meet the ambiguity You can look at these and say any of interpreted as adjusted numbers I think 15000 and changes are what were basing analysis on To us its really the benchmark of what the tia is based on _ Its not necessarily the compliance We can look at the  measure traffic in terms of taking counts There s some for example a signal is a signal warranted in the future We can take a look at counts measure them compare them against a series of warrants and see if its appropriate to signal wise Thats kind of a back check to see the true impacts to the network _ If I can add a little to that the way we enforce this is not necessarily after its built but prior to when its built We cap the trips at 15562 new 19645 total and as site plans came in we would add the traffic An office building would come in we say this is this many square feet We subtract that off the total Necessary building comes in et cetera Et cetera making sure the total development at the end of the day doesnt exceed it _ And just to reiterate council member assuming this dev elopment is built in pieces as new pieces are added you can certainly measure the trips at the driveway and compare that to the existing trips at the driveways and find what the difference is I think that allows as those new pieces come in for developme nt to have that discussion with developer where they are with with respect to the cap _ So for future reference can you tell us which is higher unadjusted or adjusted Because the concern is going to be to have the least amount of traffic possible and not be granting additional traffic than what we granted in the prior reading and since we got conflicting information can you go through how those terms play out in terms of which gives you more traffic _ Well in terms of unadjusted it starts wit h the if you will the raw rates or equations for the land use And then theres a series of adjustments that occur Might be a little hard to follow on the table but for example theres over 20000  theres a 5 percent internal capture reduction which means the relationship among the land uses You can take a reduction off the raw generation recognizing that somebody using one part of the site one land use does not necessarily generate another trip to use another one So that gets do wn to the 19000 and change Theres a credit for the 4086 trips generated by the existing office Once the math is done its net 15000 trips and change that the analysis is based on They are related to each other So essentially none adjusted would be the 20000 The adjusted  you could view as 19000 and change We look at it as 15000 ultimate reduced value that the analysis is based on _ But if we were to put a limit on 15562 unadjusted we would have less traffic than we would if why put in a cap of 5062 adjusted _ The adjusted trips are new trips created by the development They are already getting credit for the 4000 or so trips today So really what were doing because we can manage the new trips or we can regulate the new trips w hat they have today is what they have today the 4000 is sort of the starting point for this calculation _ I guess my question is that ultimately what my constituents care about is having the least amount of traffic and we passed it saying it was unad justed at one level and then we are saying that its supposed to be adjusted and my question is if the number 19000 or 15000 that we want to use for reference if its unadjusted does that imply less traffic than it being adjusted _ I do not believe  I think it gives  no I think they are essentially the same numbers even though physically one is 19 and one is 15 _ Im not asking about the  excuse me sorry to interrupt Im not asking about the number I understand where you got the 19 versu s the 15 That Im not arguing with My question if its adjusted versus unadjusted does that imply more or less traffic _ Going to one doesnt allow them to have any more trips than if we use the other For consistency we recommend you use the adjusted 15000 _ Thats what I was trying to clarify And then I had a question for Mr Rusthoven if nobody else has questions I want to confirm when you confirm the 2500 square feet there that is t he same  does that allow them to do more than just retail How do we interpret what could go there under that classification Sometimes youve heard of retail and sometimes its commercial I want to clarify what uses theyre allowing I am all for havi ng it be mixed use I want to clarify that _ Im trying to find the chart Here it is Right now it would be very limited The applicant would like to expand the possible number of commercial uses and I dont believe the staff woo be owes posed to his rewrist Right now the list is communication services which is utility thing food preparation food sales he parking lot of course for the uses religious assembly and restaurants So in real life that limits it pretty much to a restaurant The applica nt would like to add general retail sales convenience which is retail as we know it as well as personal services which are things like hair salons and fitness studio and such and would also like to add pet services which are things like pet stores or a vets office To increase the marketability if you will of that 2500 square foot space that you have on the first floor of the residential building So staff would not be opposed to those amendments but right now its pretty much limit ed to a restaurant The concern is if they couldnt find a restaurant they would have to leave the space vacant _ Correct If you like you could make an amendment to add general retail sales convenience  personal services and pet services to the list of permitted uses in exhibit D under uses permitted in the ao restaurant category If you like I could write language for that if thats the councils desire _ Im sorry I thought we were discussing th e restaurant tract But speaking to the residential tracts only their permitted uses that would be allowed there for the commercial Include a wide variety of commercial uses including admin and business office art gallery artworkshop Communication services financial services food sales general retail sales general  lets see Personal services pet services professional office and restaurant _ So just to clarify then for the retail thats being proposed under parcels 8 and 9 that would be part of the mixed use residential Thats the one that would have the more expansive recommendation Thats what you are recommending at this point _ The language today just said mixed use development is required in parcels 8 and 9 with commercial ground floor use and multi family use above the ground floor I was concerned that di d not define how much commercial there was _ So we have a base motion Is there a motion to approve what we had last week with the changes that staff laid out Is there a moti on Were looking for a motion My understanding is  Im going for a base motion Whats on the  whats the proposal on this _ The proposal on the table we have a potential third reading I think an appropriate motion would be take a motion on the third reading with amendmentes recommended by staff _ Michael Whalen on behalf of spire realty Im going to run through these qui ckly and address some motions I heard about I know theres a lot more time to discuss First I wanted to talk about what happened on second reading so everybody could physically  Im sorry  so everybody could see what we were talking about This was t he original preferred plan that was done It had  you can see the purple is the hotel Blue is office red is retail and then you have on parcel 9 the multi family with the park next to it So the supreme on second reading was to move th e five story 125 square foot office and retail to where the hotel is and eliminate the hotel so thats what happened kind of as the first move Then a new multi family building was added to parcel 8 and you can imagine it had ripple effects We had to rel ocate 125000 square feet of office that I just showed you That added 1000 square feet to parcel 6 We added 25000 square feet to building 3 so we would get back to even with 125000 square feet We would keep the parking height the same on 6 and 7 even though office retires more park sog we added parking garage above the restaurants There was a motion that passed to add a floor on parcel 9 Thats a building 100 yards away from homes Its over 390 feet awayrom single family home as cross hart lane and two floors of commercial were added on building 4 for community benefits and as we know that required the addition  or the addition after 25000 on building 3 and 40000 on building 2 Both of those are on parcel 3 required two level of parking to be added Well look at that in a moment What did I say Heres the updated plan Parcel 8 added No more commercial no more hotel We now have multi family red is retail facing the park and streets and as you move toward mopac you have the restaurant and r etail in red First thing you have as I said 100000 square feet of office and 25000 square feet on parcel 3 to get you to 125 We then kept that garage the same level but to accommodate the needed parking for the 100000 square foot of o ffice we added park on top of parcels 4 and 5 thats 53 feet then on the four story 175 unit apartment complex with ground floor retail it was added on second reading and an additional floor was added This is the one thats more than 390 feet away from the single family residence Thats what happened Two floors on the right were added up against mopac on building 4 and the parking garage had two levels added to accommodate the 65000 square feet of office that was added on that parcel Remember we too k away 125000 originally from parcel 8 so thats a lot But thats what happened on second reading And we can go back and review any and all of that of course _ I wanted to talk about minimum parking requirements There was a lot of discussion about t hat I had an opportunity to witness the work session and the first thing I really wanted to emphasize is people do not design to the minimum The minimum is  and the reason its  that people dont design to the minimum is the market wont tolerate th at and I think we saw that from the back up that people received and I thought I brought my copy here but there was the back up has as we know a parking analysis of lots and lots of class A office space and very few if any are anywhere near the mi nimum and the reason is parking in the city of Austin is a way to control density and what happens is if you limit somebodys parking levels you limit their ability to build office Thats just a fact and that is exactly what will happ en here if these levels are reduced and it will not work for a drawing we got this as tight as we can One thing thats important to note our number falls between the minimum number we selected and we had out there more than a year was a number between the minimum parking requirement outside the urban core and lower inmum requirement inside the minimum core We have a number thats right in the middle Not right in the middle And that you saw from the analysis that Mr Rusthoven shared with you at the work session One reason we did the parking garage We were encouraged by lots of neighborhood to build parking garages because it reduces impervious cover and gets cars off the street There are a lot of people that want more parking garages so people wou ld be off the street There has been confusion about this I own that thats my fault I had not been as clear about the minimum requirement and where its coming from We had our minimum requirement out there based on what we thought the market could bea r in terms of lowest possible minimum and thats what we roughly designed to when we have the levels of parking As I said it was  its been published for over a year and I think whats happened with this and I think weve seen it in todays society w hen somebody makes a mistake its elevated quite a bit and obviously social media and opportunities publicly or privately create an opportunity  a nice opportunity to pin somebody on a gotcha So the proposed put parking as I said the minimums are between the urban core minimum and standard core As you heard Mr Rusthoven He mentioned some garages I ask please mercy for someone to make a mess to allow to make sure each garages have the additional three feet The land planners not the architects the land planners that worked on the design and gave the original heights are here to explain what happened They are not architects they did not know about the beam so they have loading docks inside the garages and w ithout it well obviously not be able to have the loading dockses inside the garages T Is a gotcha in todays side and Im pleading a little mercy from folks frankly on that You saw already I think we got to develop older sites we end up hurting ourse lves It encourages sprawl its bad for the environment and hurts our tax base I know councilmember Flannigan had question with regard to that as well Less something did change We spent hours on housing and housing has become priority for this council and ultimately perhaps where we are L we found from your perspective were balancing the need for housing request for a neighborhood park Reasoningful housing occurs on d7 d10 and d9 and here will be actual containment on the creek removing impervi ous cover over two acres of impervious cover being removed Increased tax base rather than sprawl Tax mitigation which was leveraged up to 16 million Theres connectivity and of course affordable housing Again reminder moving from 66 which is 59  which is a reduction of more than 21 acres removing 16 acres of impervious cover in  were doing 20000 feet of cubic stormwater Laying back the unnamed creek and restoring the bank 15 million in park development dollars to be us ed on the remaining park and remaining money to be used on heritage park Were paying all of the money for the restoration of the creek and heritage trail et cetera et cetera And all of the money for the demolition Theres 44 percent more open space t han required on this site and ultimately which is a good thing theres  were preserving at least 75 percent of combined heritage and protective trees There are larger streetyard industries multi modal improvements and traffic cap less than maximum l egally allowed You already had a nice discussion about Mr Bollack and Mr Spiller on that As a reminder staff did recommend approval of the with about 700000 Were now at 16 million of traffic improvements More than two X of what was originally r ecommended for approval of zoning Finally affordable housing And I showed this data before District 10 has 1 percent of citywide units its the lowest amount of any district right now Austin oaks plan the current plan would inkreebs the number of i ncome restricted units by 25 percent from 175 to 220 And that translates neighborhood housings memo that translates to a community benefit of more that 128 million Thats meaningful and again maybe thats how we tie into  well its obviously ver y meaningful So environmental detention parkland open space affordable housing mixed use Its a nice mixed use A lot of people spent a lot of hours you spend an incredible amount of time of which were very grateful I hope when you talk about park ing levels Certain numbers for affordable units A minimum number you I hope you give me an opportunity how that impacts development because it will have an adverse effect Thank you very much _ Thank you Mayor mayor pro tem and council members my name is Karen Ceroni you heard from me before Last time I was here I told you about the machines that were put into our environ in a job that I was holding and how people were laid off because of those machines What I didnt say is more machines kept coming and more people kept losing their jobs And the reason I mention this is i f you approve the loss of this many heritage tree the more well ask and the more well come _ I want to remind you what the trees look like They are all individually painted This is Selina Pine top You notice part of the tree is black Thats bec ause this tree will be killed This is Patsy cline Buck Owens Buddy holly Marshal ball This one represents Stevie ray Vaughn This is Janis Joplin And this one Im going to let you try and guess but I know you dont know it so Im go ing to pass on it This is our lady yoga you might see by that foot there Thats why its called lady yoga This is Whalen Jennings This is ray price And the hardest one to do was Willie Nelson and I couldnt figure out why and I think I got it Willie Nelson looks horrible and I tried to make it look good because hes going to be saved and removed Which if you move the trees I ask that you move them to far west boulevard because the speed limit is 35 miles an hour and we are not allowed to landscap e it so oak trees would really be wonderful there The reason hes black inside is because all of the trees that he grew up with are going to be killed And so when I couldnt get him to literally look good I decided there was a reason And that was the reason There have been a lot of developments today that are kind of strange city land that is not an easement Its city land its what The city has had the petitions that we sent over three months and new things keep coming to light So the question i s why are we just now finding out about this strip of land We know that a couple of the people that signed the petition have been threatened Im not going to mention names because thats not fair to them because they have withdrawn And so you know right now we dont have a valid petition but a lot of things have changed today The presidents  had we had the valid petition when we did have it and everything kept being postponed we would be in a different place right now and prec edent has been sent that if theres a member away from the dais that in fact there is no vote and the council could actually opt to do that if they wanted to This week you also got information about salamandersalamanders The restoration of the quote creek needs to be carefully monitored because we know there are joelville salamanders underneath that ground and Im not hearing that mentioned and for the developer I would have to ask how much is enough How much profit is enough Theyve made more t han double the amount since the purchase of that property in 2013 As you know Custer had a last stand and this is Karens last stand I have been a community activist all of my adult life with the city of Austin since 1983 Ive seen many administration s Some of you know me from before We made lots of promises about things changing about how staff can approve things and Im just not seeing whats been promised all of these years And so one of the things that has come to light for me recently is in 2010 you may remember Hermine came through and did a lot of damage I tried to get the repairs done We didnt have the money I was told by Marty stump Sarah hensly on and on go to the bond hearings thats how you get money to do repa irs I went to the bond meetings I was the only citizen at these meetings I was able to get 75000 for bull creek park Bull creek park has a plan Not one thing that that money I asked for is being done Because the city staff says according to this this rule that whatever we can do this we do that So why did  why did I Im going to ask you to please vote now _ Thank you mayor mayor pro tem John ruff Royalty group Its been a long process You heard our story And know the changes I want to revisit the history a little bit We purchased Austin oaks in 2012 We did not purchase the property with the expre ss intent to redevelop Our business model as many suggested did not hinge on the success of a rezoning case Our profit that so many have been concerned with was not reliant on something which we did not have by right Instead like everything we do it was based on providing the market with the best possible product within the many limitations present Between 2012 and 2014 it became apparent to us that the market was changes The city of Austin was changing and product on the ground what is currently known as Austin oaks was not in fact the best use of the land Austin matured much faster than anyone in my industry could have managed and there was and really still is not enough product to support the growth in result and demand The 31 acres of land at the intersection of mopac and spice wood springs presented a great opportunity to address the citys growth demands after much consideration among ourselves we decided to seek zoning in order to meet market demands We began that in 2014 t wo years after we purchased the property Suffice it to say the neighborhood was not as enthusiastic about Austins growth so we reset with the neighbors in 2016 As you are well aware we participated and the end plan hundreds of hours of debate and exper tise of legal design engineering experts Since that plan the plan was refined to the point acceptable by staff and various board decisions to obtain ultimate approval at this level Nonetheless I respect authority of this council and under the plan they r equire additional modifications to meet standards for approval As I said before the while the plan is not a plan I would propose it can work as mixed use community Nonetheless Im aware of notions which may be made which are _ Sir I believe this was actually the document provided the update time of the document itself and the printing time and this could be actually probably forensically proven _ Hi my name is SHAWN Co mpton Im one of the planners on the project We were hired to work on the sure and there after we continued to work on the project to finalize the land use plan Our previous  I like to speak to the parking garage And I would like to own up to an erro r on my part We use 12 feet as the first floor module for the garages And that accommodates the commercial uses As we began we brought on an architect and for loading and offloading we learned that 15 feet is the requirement What I di d not account for was a three foot beam above the 15 foot clear zone for the parking  excuse me for the loading and unloading The rationale for why we have about 15 feet remains the same And thats for minimizing cover by having the parking  excuse me the loading and unloading within the parking garages minimize impervious cover And to allow for commercial and retail uses I know Michael is mentioned Its oversight and councilmember alter has also mentioned this and I humbly request that you add three feet to the overhaul height of the garages to accommodate for the offloading  for the  for the offstreet loading and unloading And I would like to thank you and answer any questions that you might have _ He mentioned to the garage but not all of the garages Theres a total of six garages on there He didnt mention all the garages _ On the last reading it simply was  Ill read it out The new ordinance and back up to allow up to 8 of the required affordable housing to be met with it as follows on here  And so Ill explain it after I get a second _ What this does as Ill recall we added two floors of office for abou t 16 million in community benefit on last reading 800000 of that was dedicated to affordable housing This amendment states that at the  at the citys option not the developers option The citys option the city can acquire affordable housing on site or take the money and spend it in the area around Austin oaks and around Austin oaks to leverage affordable housing opportunities So this does not create any additional benefit for the developer This creates more options for the city It would be at the discretion of  the neighborhood housing director to make this call and I would respect the authority of the neighborhood housing director to make the decision about the opportunities at the time and whether or not its best to get the units at the si te or to utilize it there _ The neighborhood housing and community development department The fee would be flexible We could look and work with your department to identify an initiative or activity that could be best served for this particular issue But I dont see that there would be any kind of restrict ions on the funding source that would preclude ap array of different activities _ Look at the changes were putting in the restrictive covenant It requires it to be done with the first commercial housing units and it wouldnt be done late in the day It will be done  its up front They make that decision _ We could come up with some kind of consumer price index or something Im su re theres language that we could draft _ Mr Whalen is saying theres no escalation in the analysis of our rents so we would want  we would want to take a little time to  to reflect on that So I think that we could think about some language that might address that if thats the will of the council _ Hi Mr Whalen Law I think  this is cover in the information that you saw The analysis they did did not include any escalation to market rents over the 40 year period And so that was a concern of ours They said rents will increase There could be some escalator to the rents in the 40 year period The analysis do not I do not think it matters based on a flat rate over a 40 year period it doesnt matter at what point this will be made Because the rate the rent hasnt changed So in my opinion if theres going to be an adjustment made based on when it happens there needs to be a cpi escalator or something similar to adjust the rents on an annual basis based on a 40 year period _ Vicinity can be defined in a reasonable geographic you know location to the pud We have  this will be something that will be a little different than what weve done and the other like for example transit or oriented districts I would say potentially half a mile is typically what we have offered up and other density bonus programs I would put that forward fo r consideration at this time Unless theres a specific area that we need to go out a little bit further to take a look at _ I would say I would want to have some flexibility working with the actual district representative Thats typically what weve seen We would be comfortable saying in the vicinity _ I want to clarify we have parking accounted for because were going see some as we go through other amendments that we dont violate that So its 60 feet of the parking garage accommodates that so you can get that out of the way _ I will remind you as we discussed in work session that if councilmember Poole was here we have the votes to pass this so well have to have a postponement if it doesnt pass _ So Im going to note that this is for four and five and where it reads 50 feet to be consistent with earlier decisions should read 53 feet So I move to meant part 5 of the ordinance and back up to limit any height or structure in parcels 4 and 5 to 53 feet and to move 10 8a to require any amendments B through K will be considered a substantial amendment Use on the ground floor parking garage 3 above the ground floor Its limited to 53 feet Its the same thing on building 6 My intention is for the restaurant to be on the ground floor and the parking above And there was ambiguity in the land use plan that we are trying to resolve And we would just want to be clear we had previously added  the last time something to deal with this notification issue and its just repeating it here for clarity _ I think were fine doing that I think because the situation is changed and not as attractive as the free standing because of the movement of the office if we could have as we could preview a few more uses and we had identified four that would help to make sure that gets occupied initially It would be for financial services There could be a small banking type situation general retail sales convenience which was mentioned Personal services That gives us flexibility to fill that space _ The only thing were concerned about that I expressed to you earlier is the market is such that we shou ld remain empty The restaurant does yield a better rent they just wont support that and will remain empty as weve seen on Cesar Chavez in the CNC buildings _ My only concern is that with the state law regarding grandfathering if we do agree to the city lags because it would adhere because everyone else says that the regulations in effect at the time of the application would apply unless theyre modified And so by doing this they say 281 d you have frozen 281 d as to this development if we in the future for example strengthen that provision that strengthened provision would not apply And Im pretty sure thats not the intent _ We can do that we have found in our deliberations at times the language is to do the language now  thats why and the pud and make sure that this doesnt provide anything beyond the particul ar modification _ Theres been suggestions about applicants in the past that dont have the sections that comply and you said no we wont do that is that it gives them a benefit rather than tying them  it ties them to something that we may strengthen in the future So I would advise against it because it will apply to them Pursuant to the terms of the code _ Mayor pro tem Environmental officer I agree with the city attorneys advice on that We generally really try to stay away from including references to exist ing code that they would have to comply with any way and  and this is something that for a long time theyve been real clear they know they have to comply with the cef requirements and the litigation requirements and in fact theyre limiting the depth of excavation and so if we were to  if  as you were saying if we were to strengthen the regulations in the future they might not have to comply with them and my recommendation would be that we remain silent on it _ Yes as they do for any trenches excavating the parking garage They start work reporting to us Our geologists and inspectors respond and evaluate those and comply with the litigation requirements Theyre required to report them to the tcq But then tcq defers to us because we can respond faster and have more stringent regulations than the state do es so they have to comply with those _ Things are attributing to me when other people talk It happens all day when we talk On the  on the subtitles It says troxclaire So if anybody is  if youre wil ling to fix that _ The part 8 in backup to reduce the height of the parking garage on three So instead of being 85 feet 75 feet or 7 12 levels _ Again those four uses are general retail sales and convenience personal services which is nails hair and pet services _ Yeah the concern is we loo ked at it aggregately and said we have X amount of square foot of quote retail and restaurant And the restaurant within some of that We start identifying a very specific piece and saying that has to be a restaurant Thats a bit more concerning because I dont know if a rest restaurant tour is going to show up and want to lease that space maybe the space down the way I would say the concept has changed when we inserted the retail spaces or restaurants whatever you want to call it into the garage versu s it being in the stand alone path site _ Its in a period of time to  to allow those three uses for a certain number of years and then convert to just restaurant _ Im wo ndering if it would be appropriate to consider the language that has a preference for a restaurant Restaurants were really  I have to say in this market restaurants are dying all the time And we can see that there are empty spaces all over the city S o Im not certain to get at what neighbors are interested in if theres some way to write the language that you know if its a restaurant if it at all possible or something to that effect so that these other uses would be secondary if you cant get a restaurant And so that seems to be what youre saying it also seems to be perhaps whats being reflected in the restaurant But we do need to be realistic in this city Restaurants are tough Its tough to keep going The restaurants come and go and come and go So a vacant space Im sure is not what the neighbors would prefer I mean theyd rather have a restaurant but they might rather have something else rather than nothing So if there was some way to make it clear that the preference is restaurant and if you have some responsibility for trying to get a restaurant in there I dont know how to word that exactly then perhaps that would address the issue _ We can bui ld up to  my understanding is we can build up to 500000 square feet of office at which time we have to deliver at least 250  oh we have to deliver on parcels 8 and 9  develop parcels 8 and 9 which are the  what are we calling that Ao mixed use before we can develop another square foot of office space _ It  it goes back to the thing about garages right These havent been designed  These havent been planned Weve kind of  this is all based on planning exercise and not in depth architectural design So I dont know definitively how many units are going to be on site there Im comfortable with the range thats on the table And I think it provides some protection that in fact the affordable units will be on the ground But Im concerned about the notion of putting in the what we term as the best case maximum number and making that now a minimum number when in fact it hasnt bee n designed it hasnt been  it hasnt been drawn by an architect _ Mayor I obviously most important to the neighbors is reducing the floor In terms of the  in the resi dential and the garage That goes with it Im not sure what youre suggesting or putting for the minimum If 250 is the number and that was 27 or 108 I would refer that to be higher that I would prefer that to be 41 The issue here is th at I think the whole deal was predicated on the notion of delivering the residential Yes we did discuss the strategic housing plan today And it was all predicated on delivering the residential whether it was the affordable or the income or the market r ate or the market rate or income restricted We have protection for this being built This is one way to encourage that I would like to see something somewhere in between the 25 and the 41 number On the parking level you know Im okay with what you prop osed but I do want to point out that thats just having them lob off three feet Thats really not  its  I think its an improvement to make a  _ If you take off a half a level and give them three feet youve only take n off three feet It needs to be done but not as big of a give as it sounds I think I would like to see the other On the restaurants I preferred your suggestion of having an interim time period if that was feasible I think not having restaurants in th is area will be problematic But I understand the applicants need to have the traffic there which would come with the residential And I dont know if theres a halfway point there _ Okay To me a half a floor is six feet If you give them an additional three feet earlier youre only getting three feet _ We can  I have an idea to address that I think We could  we can  I hope it depends on what Mrs Co tton said but we can certainly volunteer to make that space available to restaurant use first at the  the rent that we were offering to and we leave it at the same represent were not going to have a hype rent and lower the rent The right of first ref usal Make that available to restaurant use first for 60 days before we make it available generally for a commercial  for the other four uses that I had mentioned  Mentioned We can do that each time it turns over to your point to councilmember Garza  when it turns over make it available for restaurant use first _ I believe that would be impossible for the city ordinance The city is  our role is to do permanent buildings So once a building is built we dont keep track on a monthly basis of who the tenant is But we could encapsulate that in a letter and stick it in the file and say this is the councils intent that this be done But I dont thin k that is enforceable language for an ordinance _ Councilmember Garza raises a good point with respect to shifting with the tenant So I will go with your statement on  _ On the parcel Yes I do want to point out that we are only getting 25 or  I dont know did we decide on 27 or 25 Whats the number Its 27 _ Im sorry to interrupt you I just want to clarify one of the other parts with respect to the restaurant was that we wanted to limit the height to the parcel not just to the structure so that you wouldnt have any ambiguity about adding the 30 to the 50 So that the height was  that the height of the building or structure on parcel 4 was limited to the 53 feet _ Slow down Please explain it again because now I felt like it was an amendment to the amendment so please explain ]\n",
