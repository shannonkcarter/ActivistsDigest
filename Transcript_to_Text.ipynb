Across the myriad areas of need and opportunity that \\nfind their place on the days agenda, may there be a coming together of minds, perspectives, wills, even \\nthese g\\noals in ways that allow for the creative melding of these in the service of the public good. On a \\nday on which many will commemorate the example of a teacher come from god who wrapped a towel \\naround his waist and washed the feet of his followers, grant to \\neach of us such a spirit of practical and \\ncompassionate service and self\\n-giving so that by the day's end, this city we call home will be better for \\nwhat has happened here. \\n  [10:09:24 AM]\\n  Amen. \\n \",\n",

And one more. \\nWe're approving the waiver residency requirement of section 2.1.21 of the city code for the service of \\nBashir Mohammed on the mechanical plumbing and solar board. There are nominees listed on here for \\nthe manager search committ\\nee. Of course those will be relevant if, in fact, we pass item number 22, \\nwhich is a board and commission \\n-- I'm sorry, which is item number 27. Why? \\n  [10:11:25 AM]\\n  Okay. So you're going to pull ahead number 22, I'm sorry, 27. Do you need item 22. Yes. T\\nhat's the pull. \\nSo we're going to pull 22 and 27. You can't do them simultaneously? Okay. We'll do it that way. We're \\ngoing to pull 9, 10, 19 and 22. I don't know if there's anything else to be pulled. We do have people to \\nspeak on the consent agenda. \\n \",\n",

I know there's been complaints. I know we'll inspect the units \\nfor deficiencies and problematic issues. I was wondering why this did not occur quicker. I had a phone \\ncall last year about this property. Unfortunately, I was in the hospital\\n again so I was not able to address \\nit with you. But in the future, that's more pertinent and more efficient in listening to the complaints of \\nthe resident. I understand that the owner has been cited or will be cited. But that's not enough. Number \\n15 is th\\ne Austin community college increased funding for child care equality. Any increase for child care \\nequality is a no\\n-brainer. Child \\n-- children \\n-- child needs health care and they're not getting it. A lot of \\npeople in east Austin. A lot of children are not g\\netting top care at the children's hospital. I've seen it. \\nThey say call the mayor. That's your job. You said number 16. Number 16 is just a increasing for the \\ncommunity network and Raul is the the executive director of the organization.

So this is an appropriate \\n-- appropriate \\nfunding for the Austin children for women and children. I\\'ll always support them. You sa\\nid number 18, \\nright? Number 18 has to do with increased mentoring is a no\\n-brainer. \\n  [10:15:30 AM]\\n  Former teacher at ACC, Austin independent school district. And I taught also juniors in college.

       " \" Mayor pro tem, councilmembers. I think it's important that we're doing this. I'm hopeful that this \\nproperty, you know, doesn't\\n end up being demolished and replaced with market rate housing. What we \\nhave done and we have to do this, we have to help these families. But I'm concerned that we're going to \\n\\nend up facilitating the demolition of affordable housing. Is there any way we ca\\nn hold the property \\naccountable for repairing this property and allowing the families to come back in? Low\\n-income families, \\nother families to come back in and remain in the neighborhood. I'm just very concerned about this. And \\n\\nI think this is really import\\nant that we use this as an opportunity to look down the road and see in other \\nparts of our city where is this about to happen again? Which of our other properties are like this where \\nthe property owners are not taking care of them? They're becoming dilapid\\nated, becoming unsafe. \\nThat's an excuse for go get some tenant relocation money and then clear out and we're going to clear \\nout for market rate housing. \\n  [10:25:50 AM]\\n  They have a term for this in cities like Austin where this is occurring. It's called r\\necolonization. Existing \\nresidents are pushed out and being recolonized by affluent high\\n-income families. I'm not criticizing those \\nfamilies. I know that's part of the \\n-- part of the system, part of the process that we're trying to deal with. \\nI understand t\\nhat. But we have to find different ways to see this. Otherwise, diversity of color, low \\nincome families from our central neighborhoods. Then our only tool seems to be let's provide density \\nbonus housing and we have families pushed out of single family hous\\ning that they could afford and their \\nonly alternative is to come back and live in an apartment, a small apartment. And they do well that way. \\nSo I'm concerned about this. I appreciate this item. I know we had to do this. But we need to see where \\nelse is th\\nis about to happen. And figure out a way that we can hold those property owners accountable, \\nnow, to bring the properties into compliance and safe for the tenants. Thank you very much. \\n \",\n",

I hope we hold the prope\\nrty owners accountable and bring \\nthe funds, not just from legal judgments, but also from our own budgets and bonds to copt to keep this \\narea integrated. It's actually in one of our homestead preservation districts and as Mr. King asks the \\nquestion of where\\n are we seeing this happening? It's happening in this part of the city and we actually \\nauthorized some funding for rehabilitation at the timbers apartment just up the road off of Clayton lane. \\n\\nSo this is an area that is seeing that little deterioration. On\\ne of my first questions is whether or not we \\ncould do rehab there.

I have been since I was really trying to focus \\nas much of our code department's efforts on these sorts of dangerous situations because it's \\nunacceptable for us to have folks potentially get hurt in those dan\\ngerous situations and it's important \\nfor the code department and law departments to really hold folks accountable when they let the \\n\\nproperties get to the level where folks are living in bad conditions.

In the memo dated April 5, we talked a at\\n-bat ways in which they \\nresponded to the memo and tri\\ned to use more local banks and develop partnerships with local and \\nregional banks. That's one of the things I was thanking them for. They have taken the spirit of the \\ninterest of council as stated by the resolution and really tried to expand the city's par\\ntnerships with local \\nand regional banks. I'm making the amendment because I'm still hopeful there might be additional work \\nwe can do and might be a policy discussion to have whether it is possible to use a regional bank, at least, \\nor even a conglomeration \\nof local banks or some other alternative for the city of Austin's major banking \\nneeds. Again, like the mayor after I read that memo, I wasn't sure what those options would look like.

Let's get input from high \\n\\nschool students, not only high school students and ACC students that need affordable housing and ge\\nt the different definition of what affordability is and what the needs are.

It tasks you to the 110% \\n-- I have the verbiage, I better not use what we use in the Marine Corps. It taxes you to do mor\\ne than you \\ncan. So your physical fitness is not as good as it was when you are younger. We need affordable housing. \\n\\nI recommend we address this issue even at the high school level. I met principals that want to allow \\nstudents to be made accommodation to sp\\neak to y'all in front of the council, but they're not able to \\nmake it because of scholastic issues. Send out fliers to the high schools. Get their input also. Because \\nthey're going to need affordable housing, also. Not just us. There is a lack of real, tru\\ne-blue affordable \\nhouses. You ask anyone in the street is that affordable. $1,200 a month apartment is not affordable. \\nAnyway. I will keep it short. \\n  [11:11:52 AM]\\n  I was looking through item 10.

Next week, you \\n\\nhave an opportunity to d\\nraft council agenda number 5 to give neighborhood housing and community \\ndevelopment tools to be able to track building permits and C.O.S to see how good we are or aren't doing \\non an annual basis for the market rate housing and affordable housing we're tryi\\nng to produce. Finally, \\nyou will have on your agenda next week, the opportunity hopefully not to just consider the 2015 \\nuniform plumbing code we talked about last week, but also the residential provision, the plumbing \\nprovisions of the international reside\\nntial code and international plumbing code, but the current posting \\nlanguage is so narrow you can't consider what you talked about last week, so I hope you fix it before \\nFriday's posting.

       " \" Thank you ma\\nyor, councilmembers, my name is David king, I'm speaking on item 10, 24, 25. Items 10, \\n24, 25. Regarding the strategic housing plan, I'm glad you're taking public input on it. I hope you will \\nallow the zoning and planning commission to take public input an\\nd provide feedback to you before you \\nformally adopt it as part of the imagine Austin comprehensive plan. Regarding item 24, the \\nimplementation of the plan and indter disciplinary action team for the housing plan, I think this is \\nimportant item that needs t\\no be passed. I'm glad \\n-- this shows you're serious about taking the plan and \\nworking the plan and implementing the plan. I think this is very important that this particular item be \\n\\napproved. What I would suggest is that we include \\n-- that we include look b\\nack process to look back and \\nsee how effective our housing strategies have been. Like the density bonus programs and what goals do \\nwe have. For example, is a goal of the density bonus program to provide a variety of affordable housing? \\nI'm talking about de\\ntached single\\n-family housing or primarily a goal for apartments, affordable \\napartments? We need to have a metric that gives us input, information. And we need a goal that's clear. \\nI think it is important that we have a goal that says we want to help low in\\ncome families be able to live in \\ndetached single\\n-family homes where they can own them. And gain wealth through that process. That's \\nimportant and strategic. I think we need goals to see how many of those homes have we produced? \\n  [11:18:00 AM]\\n  How many do\\n we want to produce? We should have that level of granularity. It seems like we're putting \\nall our eggs in the basket of affordable apartments. And I'm concerned that what we're doing with \\nwhat's going on, the redevelopment of our community, that we're los\\ning the single\\n-family detached \\nhousing that low\\n-income families have today and replacing them with apartments. And I don't think \\nthat's equitable. So I think we need some metrics that talk about \\n-- that gives us insights into the \\naverage amount of land occ\\nupied by low and middle income families versus high income families. The \\nrelative percentage of low\\n-income families that live in single\\n-family detached housing versus \\napartments. And I've told you before that they're consistently, the real estate industry \\nshows that \\nfamilies of all income levels, of all colors by 75% or higher prefer to live in single\\n-family detached \\nhousing, if they could afford it. I think our housing policy should be informed by that. We is have metrics \\nand goals that give us insights in\\nto that. And one other suggestion that I have is that we include the \\noffice of equity in item 25 and regarding the resolution of preserve affordable housing along the \\n\\ncorridors. That is important for the office of kweshgsitty to be \\n-- equity to be involved\\n in that as well. \\nBoth of those. Thank you very much. \\n \",\n",

Just taking into account \\nregular population growth, not actually trying to\\n move the needle on affordability as far as I can tell \\nfrom the way they calculated the 135 total units.

I \\nheard some comments in the prior public testimony, sort of about zoning capacity. I wanted to just \\nrelate that zoning capacity does not equal what actually gets built. So we need to be sure as we consider \\ncodenext that we're not sort of capping the\\n capacity at additional 135 units we will think about what we \\nwill actually build as a result of the code next process.

We need a plan that keeps things \\nfrom getting worse, but need a plan to make things better. Austin is in a\\nn affordability and traffic crisis. \\nWe are losing and lost many long\\n-standing low\\n-income residents and even some middle class residents. \\nWhat we're doing is not sustainable environmentally, fiscal, and not sustainable fiscally. People should \\nbe able to cho\\nose their neighborhood and not have it chosen but their socioeconomic status. \\n  [11:22:17 AM]\\n  Inclusion should be the number one priority when it comes to how much housing we allow to be built. \\nDon't fall for the fallacy that the housing shortage isn't th\\ne cause of the crisis. When people are bidding \\non one house, that drives up the price. When landlords know tenants don't have good options, they can \\nand do jack up rents. We're losing loss of old affordable units to renovation, prices are going up because \\nyou don't build housing in places people want to live. If you want to preserve old apartment complexes, \\nyou need new apartment complexes built in old places not just on top of where it is allowed now. Allow \\n\\nnear more housing to be sure we're being inclusiv\\ne. Most of the satellite cities where people are forced \\nto drive. By predicting most of our growth will be outside of the city limits and planning for that and \\n\\nbasing 135 units with that idea in mind, we're creating a self\\n-fulfilling policy that will creat\\ne environmentally destructive sprawl. By forcing people that want to live in the cities, to live in the \\nsuburbs, producing them to buy more car, produce more CO2 emission and more traffic. We should \\nfocus on making it easier for people to drive less often \\nand drive shorter distances. Not making it easier \\nto drive long distances. No one is saying single\\n-family housing should go away entirely. We should allow \\nmore smaller houses on smaller lots. If you live in central Austin, you shouldn't limit who can limit\\n in \\nyour neighborhood to people who can afford single\\n-family houses. The solution needs to focus on \\ninclusion.

Since you were brainwashed by \\nCasar, y'all are in that traffic wasting time,\\n indirectly losing years of your life. You are literally going to \\nhave a shorter lifespan because of time lost and because of pollution. This is the ultimate payback. I may \\ndecide to give the answers to the get city council, if they are not a bunch of trai\\ntors. You wouldn't \\nbelieve the most common response. It was really weird in fact and weird. And I got it all on my CV. \\nThey're almost obsolete. I don't have to worry about someone stealing this, but there is always payback. \\nPreviously, I warned the others \\nto let Acevedo go, after he wanted to leave. He department even stay a \\ndecade. I did my homework. Should've seen all the negativity coming from California. You may say, she \\ndoesn't like art or Casar, and they are hispanic. I'm on a higher level. I'm for my\\n country. You see, I'm \\nplaying chess while some of y'all are still playing checkers. I conducted a brief survey last night and asked \\npolice officers how they liked Brian. \\n  [12:05:56 PM]\\n  They said they loved him. Media has said officers are nicer now. Tha\\nt was not the case with art. People \\nread between the lines. He was brought in because he spoke Spanish. All the attention was on art. He \\nwas too social, trying to win a popularity contest. Officers did not like that attention was on him, not the \\nentire pol\\nice department. We need Brian Manley. Make it happen when the city manager says so and it \\nis up for a vote. He needs to become the next police chief. This is his stomping ground! I've still got \\ntime? I guess I'll repeat some of my stuff. Previously, the co\\nuncil had the bright idea to boycott Arizona \\nbecause of their immigration stance. Boy, I hope they enjoyed the lab scandal and the killing of prop 15. \\n\\nWe said vote yes for everything except prop 15. Vote no. That's how we did it. \\n [ Beeping ] \\n \",\n",

I've got my own consulting company. I have 47 years of design, \\n\\nconstruction, and maintenance of streets and highways. And even thou\\ngh I have a powerpoint, I've got \\nto tell you that the thing that hits me the most is the traffic, the amount of traffic that's going to be put \\non our neighborhood streets. \\n  [2:15:53 PM]\\n  Not on mopac, or spicewood, but our neighborhood streets. Nothing ha\\ns been done about that. There \\nare no mitigation activities for our neighborhood streets. You know, heart lane is a rollercoaster up and \\ndown. They probably cut it with a bulldozer following the guy going down, that's how it was done, no \\nengineering design,\\n no safety considerations, nothing. You can see it right here on these slides, starting \\non the left, that car is going down the hill, disappears, goes up. And at the very top is green trails. And in \\nbetween is hidden hollow and stone cliff drive. These peo\\nple have to get out of there every day, come in \\nand come out every day. Here is the cars coming up to green trails subdivision. That's our entrance. You \\ncome up there and you have to take your life into your own hands when you start turning left. And now \\nwith four or five times more traffic, this is going to be a real problem. You can see how they're going \\ndown north to spicewood springs road. That's an intersection you can see in the far part of the picture. \\nIt's executive drive and the intersection of hea\\nrt lane and spicewood springs road. There's a lot of kids \\nthat walk to school. They ride their bikes. It's a big deal over there. The people in apartments, they walk \\nthere. And so what are we doing about all this stuff? To me, the first thing is safety. Sa\\nfety of not only \\nthe people in their cars, but also the pedestrians and neighborhood people. We have to focus on that. \\n\\nAnd we have not done that. We should have a traffic study to focus on what we can do to keep most of \\nthat traffic or make it safe on our \\nneighborhood streets.

So the miracle on second street continues. I would \\nurge you to adopt the housing plan, but not as an element or amendment of imagine Austin. I don't \\n\\nthink that the change in the posting from taking action to amend imagine Austin to makin\\ng it an element \\nof imagine Austin has addressed the problem on pages 223 and 224. \\n  [2:24:16 PM]\\n  And despite any legal opinions to the contrary, it's my view that you cannot simply ignore those pages or \\nthe procedure for amendment that is set forth in the\\nm. As far as the target number, I think you need to \\ndo at least two things \\n-- one is to add the 48,000 current deficit in affordable housing in income \\nrestricted housing that exists today. If we pass a housing plan that doesn't try to solve the current \\naffordable housing problem, that seems to me to be improper. As I said last week, the planning \\ncommission voted 6\\n-6 on a motion to raise the number by 48,000. So you need to do what the planning \\ncommission almost did with respect to the target. Also, I'd like\\n you to consider Peter park's comment to \\nme a couple of months ago in terms of affordability vis\\n-a-vis codenext, and that was that you cannot \\nagain to impact price in any significant way until you create a significant oversupply of housing. And \\nthat's your\\n consultant speaking. They didn't do that in Denver, the last place that Peter got a code \\nadopted. And since that code has been in place the last seven years, Denver's median price has risen \\n20% faster than ours has under our current code. So, I would ask \\nthat you seriously take into account \\nthose two numbers, whatever they are, 48,000 plus whatever in addition to the 135. Thank you, council. \\n \",\n",

       " \" Hello. My name is Jay, I'm execut\\nive director of a nonprofit think tank called farm and city. \\n  [2:26:22 PM]\\n  I live in district 7 in a traditional duplex. I think from the '50s. I have a master's in public policy from the \\nlbj school and have worked for Texas nonprofits focused on regiona\\nl growth and housing and \\ntransportation policy for the last decade. My overall comment is to urge that the target 135,000 number \\n\\nbe seen as a lower bound and not an upper limit on the amount of houses we need in Austin over the \\nnext, like, 20\\n-25. Some thin\\ngs I want to share with you, the official campo regional forecasts that are \\nused to plan all of our transportation infrastructure say that we will add 2,132,080 people by 2040 to \\n\\nreach 4,120,000 people, over 78,966 more people every year on average. The ci\\nty of Austin's currently \\n44% of the region and to maintain that regional share, we should add 34,900 more people every year. \\nOr about 13,960 houses. However, I know that the regional campo forecasts are highly problematic. \\nThey use data from the Texas stat\\ne demographer that the demographer recommends using for short\\n-range planning. And they allocate a ridiculous amount of growth to hays and Williamson county. An \\noutcome should be achieved with current development patterns and car\\n-dependent transportation \\nsystems is a nightmare of transportation. Cap cog, on the other hand, uses the data recommends be \\nused for short\\n-range planning, predicting 1.2 million less people in the region than campo does. The \\nflawed campo forecast impacts the allocation of transportat\\nion dollars across the region, and the \\ncitizens of Austin are getting less than we deserve. \\n  [2:28:22 PM]\\n  It impacts capital metro's project connect process, and means that we cannot optimize that project. And \\ntxdot's studies that claim endless traffic a\\nre based on the flawed forecast. So to whatever extent you \\npush growth outside the city, you are increasing regional vehicle miles traveled. You are increased our \\ncarbon footprint, and you are increasing traffic. When you look at the memo the demographer s\\nent you, \\nyou'll see he's lobbying hard for continuing the sprawl pattern in the Austin region, an odd thing for city \\nstaff to do. However, he seems to be using the cap cog data, which is intended for long\\n-range planning, \\nnot the campo data appropriate for \\nshort\\n-range planning. His projections for city growth through 2025 \\ncontain a radical change in the city's growth patterns, also. \\n [ Beeping ] \\n \",\n",

Although I'm \\ninvolved in many things, and I was serving as the co\\n-chair of the working group on real estate and \\nhousing of the mayor's special task force on institutional racism and all of the\\n things that we dealt with \\nin that, I want to speak as a private citizen based on my work in that, because I want to recommend \\nsome additions to the strategic plan, particularly if it is going to be an addendum to imagine Austin. \\n  [2:30:43 PM]\\n  I concur with the previous two speakers that we probably do need to state a number of housing units \\nthat we know we are down and need to move up. My understanding from the housing department, \\nright now that number is around 60,000, and probably as we speak\\n it's going up, because as we have \\nmore people moving in, we have a larger need for affordable housing. Now, going to the report from the \\nwork group, there were actually two major recommendations made. And I think that we need to have \\nlanguage along these \\nlines included in the strategic plan. One is that the city of Austin intends to, plans \\nto, or will create a specific fund, a local fund. And we gave a number of ways that that fund could be \\nachieved, to create housing not just affordable housing, but to cr\\neate a comprehensive program to \\nredress institutional racism in Austin real estate and housing. Related to that is, we call upon the city of \\nAustin to recognize and redress the racial injustices that were caused at least in part by prior city policies \\nand \\nthe on\\n-going systemic inequities that continue. After all, you know we are the large city in the \\nUnited States with the highest economic and racial segregation. That's not something we want to be \\nproud of. We're considered Progressive. We want to get past \\nthat. And I know you all agree with that. \\nNow, thinking about the specific things that I'd like to add within that comprehensive program, on page \\n\\n23 of the report, we talk about Portland. They had a criteria for bringing former residents back to \\ngentrified\\n areas. And we think that that would be a good place to start in looking at redressing racial \\ninjustice. So that's item 2.2.1 under fair housing and the right to choose. \\n  [2:32:49 PM]\\n  Under 2.3.1 under rental housing, again, following Portland's lead, th\\nere is an application that Portland \\nis working with the private developer to put into place right now that we think Austin should also look \\ninto doing. And that would help both developers \\n-- y'all making decisions, and people trying to move \\ninto Austin \\n-- find affordable housing units so that apartments that have affordable housing, whether \\nthey are ones that we are approving right now or ones in the past, that those units be placed on this \\napplication so that a person coming into town can find out, hey, th\\nere's something over here and that's \\nfairly close to where I'm going to be working. And that's a fairly simple thing that we could do that \\nwould really help everybody. Y'all, because you would have information to finally make some decisions \\non instead of h\\naving to look at the demographer's information and sort of extrapolate from that. You \\nwould know exactly where the units are. And then we had made some suggestions for the right to stay. \\nAnd we think that one of the things that's really important is helpin\\ng people who are long\\n-term \\nresidents of minority neighborhoods or formerly minority neighborhoods in Austin to help them with \\n-- former councilmember Raul was involved in a nonprofit that works with the valley neighborhood and \\nhas expanded a bit to offer a\\n onetime\\n-only payment for property taxes that the person may have fallen \\nbehind in. They don't just do this onetime thing, they then train the people on how to predict how much \\nthey need to be saving each month to be able to keep up with their property tax\\nes and help them find \\npeople who can help them protest tax increases. And we recommend that that be expanded to help a \\nlot more people than just one neighborhood. \\n  [2:34:50 PM]\\n  And another thing that we think is very important \\n-- that I personally want t\\no recommend \\n-- is that we \\nhave the chief equity officer use the new equity lens that's being developed to look at housing projects \\nspecifically in currently or previously minority neighborhoods to try and help ensure that we don't \\ncontinue to push poor peo\\nple of color completely outside the city.

I'm happy to be in councilmember kitchen's \\ndistrict. So I wanted to take a look at the numbers\\n set forth in the strategic housing plan. And I'm \\ngenerally in favor of this plan. I'm glad that we're putting some numbers to the problem so that we \\nhave, you know, a goal to shoot for. But I want to take a look at how we achieve the needed number of \\nhous\\ning units for each, you know, income range and whether, you know, we have the capacity and the \\nfunding to be able to do that by 2025. So, I was messing around in excel this morning. And I decided to \\ncalculate, essentially, taking a look at annual rent grow\\nth between now and 2025, what the funding gap \\nor what amount of subsidy would be required to subsidize the number of units for one full year. \\n  [2:39:14 PM]\\n  So this is an annual figure. And I will \\n-- after I walk you through this chart, I will kind of exp\\nlain my \\ncalculations in a little more detail. But if we're able to reverse market rate and rent increases by 2% a \\nyear \\n-- so this is annual rent growth of \\n-2%, then the funding gap in year 2025 would be about $128 \\nmillion. I shouldn't say funding gap, but \\nthat would be the amount of subsidy required to house this \\nnumber of people, or to create this number of housing units. If we go back to 10% annual rent growth \\nwhich is about the rate of growth we saw between 2008 and 2014, then that figure jumps to $1.335\\n billion annually. And, you know, that's a very difficult number for us to achieve on an ongoing annual \\nbases going forward from year 2025. So the way I calculated this is for each income bucket I calculated \\n-- and this is assuming that the current median \\nrent is 1300 \\n-- approximately 1300 as put forth in the plan. \\nSo based on that number, I compounded on an annual basis up to 2025 what rent would be. And for \\nexample, at the top, this is assuming \\n-2% rent growth, which would drive market rate rents down to \\n1,106. Assuming 10% annual rent growth, and assuming people can spend up to a third of their income \\n\\non rent. \\n [ Beeping ] \\n \",\n",
       " \" So, to summarize my findings, basically, unless we can build enough market\\n-rate housing units, we're \\nnot going to be able to stret\\nch our subsidized dollars far enough to close the housing gap and to provide \\nenough units. \\n  [2:41:25 PM]\\n  \",\n",

The only couple of things \\nthat I would highlight for you is that you do need to do what \\nyou did this morning and follow through on looking specifically at corridors and how you can create a \\ndiverse level of housing for diverse families along these corridors. And I think that would \\nbe helpful. The \\nsecond thing is there is an existing gap that you need to incorporate into the total amount of housing \\nthat you want. You might as well think big. And you might as well go for creating a diversity of housing \\nstock that would meet the needs \\nof this city. I would highlight for you that the Austin board of realtors is \\nabout 12,000 strong. You're going to hear from some of our leadership after me. The board of realtors \\ndoes a very deliberate process for analyzing issues. And included in that is \\nour legislative management \\nteam. We look at these very carefully. We take on issues are balanced, reasoned, and diverse and take \\ninto consideration the needs of neighborhoods, families, and this city. The major point I would ask the \\ncity council to conside\\nr today is to please recognize and reach out not just to this interdepartmental \\ngroup, which the city needs to include, and I congratulate you on that, but you need to reach out to the \\nother institutions in this city. \\n  [2:43:34 PM]\\n  You need to ask the co\\nunty, cap metro, ACC and aid, to get involved in the fundamental element of \\ncreating housing opportunities.

I am a past chair of the legislative management team at \\nthe board of realtors that Mr. Hilgers just mentioned, I'm a director at the board of realtors. This \\nyear I \\nchaired a policy team which is focused on growth and development issues, in particular, codenext. And \\nso I'm bring that context with me to the discussion this afternoon. We support the goals of the strategic \\nhousing plan. With attention to what code\\nnext says about how to incorporate changes, we do \\nencourage you to adopt this as an element of \\n-- codenext or imagine Austin, and to incorporate it as a \\npart of the plan. \\n  [2:45:49 PM]\\n  I do ask you to make sure that as you do that, you incorporate metrics into the plan. On pages 223 and \\n224 that you've heard mentioned before in imagine Austin, there's discussion of annual and five\\n-year \\nperformance monitoring. And that is intended to driv\\ne changes to the plan as time goes by. I would add \\na note that we are skeptical about being able to achieve everything that's needed in 3% of the city. \\nThat's not an awful lot of land. I've not done the math to see how many square miles that is, but it wil\\nl be very dense in that area, in my estimation. More importantly, I ask you to keep the end in mind. \\n\\nCodenext is the reason we're all here. And actually, what allows the strategic housing plan to get the \\nvisibility it is. The truth is, we need a lot more t\\nhan 135,000 units. You've heard the 135,000 will keep us \\neven with where we are right now, and that's assuming the population doesn't outrun that growth. But \\n\\nwe're not going to be able to build and control the cost of every unit that's needed. We need a fa\\ncility \\nthat allows the market to participate in deciding what gets built and where, and at what cost. I'd also ask \\n\\nyou to take the large view of this. This is not just about the city of Austin. Obviously, all of you were \\nelected by constituents in the city\\n. But our ineffective code and development permitting process right \\nnow is actively exporting low\\n- and middle\\n-income workers and families to the suburbs. With them, we \\nare driving housing supply, housing affordability issues, miles around. We're pushing th\\ne transportation \\nrequirements that are complicated enough just inside the city many miles away and complicating \\ncommutes for everyone involved. \\n  [2:47:57 PM]\\n  \\nWater, other infrastructure requirements, all are being pushed into the suburbs. \\n [ Beeping ] \\n \",\n",

It is disappearing so rapidly. I \\nhave issues with the plan, which contains directives which align the concepts of the free market to solve \\nthe affordable housing problems rather than building a concrete ho\\nusing fund that could really work. \\nMy first concern is that the imagine Austin plan is to be amended with this document before codenext is \\nworked out. I urge you not to do that. And then there's specific points that I'm going to bring up. At least \\n75% of n\\new housing units should be within a half mile of imagine Austin centers and corridors. The way \\nthis concept was presented at the affordable housing workshop I attended was that there should be no \\n\\nsingle\\n-family housing within a quarter mile of any bus route\\n. I clarified that it was route and not stop. My \\nneighborhood, which was built as a working\\n-class housing neighborhood, houses averaging 850 square \\nfeet, has five houses not within that area \\n-- that boundary. Another part of the document says, maintain \\nexisting homes affordable to community members, but the policies for implementation imply massive \\nremoval of existing housing stock to make room for these new units. \\n  [2:49:58 PM]\\n  The areas targeted will be those with smaller units. Now, there is allowed th\\ne development of smaller \\nhouses on smaller lots. This is a great concept for city land or new subdivisions, but I'm concerned about \\nwhat it will do to existing neighborhoods with the formation of micro\\n-lots. Relaxed regulations on both \\ninternal and externa\\nl accessory dwelling units, ads. If you are serious about ads being built for affordable \\n\\nhousing, limit their size and prevent them from being used as short\\n-term rentals. There's a big section \\non the relationship between parking requirements and affordabil\\nity, assuming that if you remove the \\nparking requirements, all of a sudden there'll be a whole lot of affordable housing, not considering that \\nthe land prices will go way up, and not considering that we have no fundamental sidewalk network in \\nthe city of A\\nustin. The strategic housing plan closely embraces the tenets of new urbanism. Lots reduce \\nparking and access to transit. Research has shown that this does not produce affordable housing. Only a \\nsmall percentage of people who make the median income can aff\\nord housing developments on these \\nprinciples. Published in 2016, data for 152 new urbanist projects were obtained. And it was found that \\n23 out of 152 developments, only 15%, were affordable to someone making the area median income. \\nAnd we're not talking a\\nbout people on the low\\n-income scale. \\n [ Beeping ] \\n \",\n",

I got interested in the Austin strategic housing plan because of its impact on my business. I know \\nothers who have businesses on activity corridors. I endorse the concept of affordable housing, but I do \\nnot believe this plan delivers i\\nt. On the screen is a map I made of what this plan will do to Austin. I took a \\nhalf a mile red border around each of the activity corridors. This represents a 3500 square foot lot with \\nsix units. There's actually denser development than this. Take a look a\\nt the activity of the corridor \\nanalysis I did, which is next. This gives you a layout of all of the activity corridors, their length, and the \\nlocation, north, south, east, or west. This, if filled out with one\\n-mile\\n-wide activity corridors, would create \\n5.1\\n million new units. And according to the demographer in Austin, that would allow us to put in 12.47 \\nmillion residents in Austin, Texas. I believe that's a little more than what we need at this time. I'm fairly \\n\\nstunned at the speed of this process, the lack\\n of data in it, the lack of imagine austin\\n-required analysis, \\nand the fact the city is prepared to develop density one mile wide down each activity corridor. \\n  [2:53:59 PM]\\n  I didn't even plot the centers.

Small businesses pay a staggering amount of taxes, yet we have four \\nweeks to read and digest this document. Based on current\\n Seattle analysis, that Ms. Mcarthur referred \\nto, it appears that lower parking requirements will actually run families out. Let me say that as a \\nbusinessman, I would never, ever take this dramatic a change on the way I operate, especially to \\nbusiness cust\\nomers that I have. This is a big mistake, in my estimation. It will hurt business in a way I \\ncan't comprehend \\n-- who my new customers are going to be as the patchwork quilt of redevelopment \\nexplodes. Who are they, what do they want at what price, where's t\\nhe traffic capacity to bring my \\ncustomers in, where are my parking spaces, where are the families, and will the flooding hit my \\n\\nbusiness? As a businessman, I constantly need to know the law. Changes to imagine Austin should be \\naddressed through the annual \\nreview, on page 220. Zoning decisions should be guided by imagine \\nAustin, page 220. Continued protection and preservation of existing neighborhoods to avoid \\nendangering the character of the neighborhoods continued protection and preservation of existing \\nne\\nighborhoods, page 219. One second. Council, there is none of this in the above document. Affordable \\nhousing is a laudable goal, but this document does not deliver it. You can't build cheaper housing on \\nexpensive land. If you want this done right, please do\\n not approve this document. \\n \",\n",

       " \" Hello. My name is Mary, and I live in district 7. I'm also a board member for Ora, which advocates for \\nan Austin for everyone\\n. I'm here to testify in support of this plan. I've been very impressed with the staff \\nengagement. I actually got a presentation from them back in December, because they provided a draft \\n\\nand were able to engage the community, which I very much appreciate. \\nAnd I see how that draft has \\nbeen updated based on a lot of community feedback, so I really appreciate all the staff time that has \\ngone into this document. There are a few areas I'd like to call out as particularly good that I think get lost \\nin all the shu\\nffle. And they should be maintained in any plan that does pass. So in particular, the focus on \\nhousehold affordability where you incorporate transit costs into people's actual ability to afford a home \\nis really, really important. The analysis supporting re\\nductions in parking is particularly beneficial, as it \\ndirectly affects rent paid by our lowest\\n-income residents. We need to focus on housing people, not cars, \\nespecially as we talk about changes in autonomous vehicles and things like that. And just because\\n we're \\nremoving parking minimums in certain areas doesn't mean that people won't continue to offer them to \\ntheir residents and businesses. I'm especially in favor of the mention of allowing internal adus, small \\nlots, which all provide more options to resid\\nents. When I lived in Chicago, where the standard lot size is \\n3,000 \\n-- about 3,000 square feet, I lived in a three\\n-flat home that the owner lived on the first floor, \\nanother family lived on the floor above us, and we had a shared back yard and it was wonde\\nrful. I could \\nwalk to the daycare, to the bus, to the transit stop, the grocery store, and I didn't need a car. So it was \\nway more affordable for me and it didn't have parking, either. \\n  [2:58:06 PM]\\n  So I also bicycle every day, even now, expecting at eig\\nht months, I still take my children to school. So I'm \\nencouraged to see that mention of connecting bicycle and sidewalk infrastructure to people's housing \\nchoices. So, overall I support this plan. And the only change I would add is to request that unit tar\\nget be \\nbasically a lower threshold or to potentially even increase is, because it's a goal, not a commitment. And \\nit doesn't account for many of the single persons who live with other people who have, you know, \\nmentioned in various surveys that they would \\nlike to live alone if they could afford that. But they \\ncurrently can't. And the growth numbers only look at current demand, which we're not even able to \\nmeet people at 100% mfi right now, people who make median family income cannot afford a home in \\nAustin.\\n So we need to address that. And I thank you for your time today. \\n \",\n",

       " \" Good afternoon, mayor, mayor pro tem, councilmembers. I thank you forgiving me the opp\\nortunity \\nto talk with you here today. I'm here in support of the strategic housing plan. I will briefly talk about \\nthree things. First, as you all know, the draft housing strategic plan is a two\\n-year process and it has \\ninvolved a ten\\n-year community convers\\nation so we have had multiple opportunities for the community \\nto chip in and give their feedback on this. A plan that is [inaudible] From this process answers a lot of \\n\\nneeds specified by the community and I think it is drastically better than what we have \\ntoday which is \\nnothing. \\n  [3:00:06 PM]\\n  So having the plan and supporting it would be something we should do moving forward in keeping our \\naffordability goals of the city. Second, I believe council should adopt the plan before we move to the \\ncodenext proce\\nss. Codenext is a multi year projecten if you try to align that we will needlessly delay the \\nplan which is not something we would potentially want. As has been said, the plan specifies our goals for \\nthe next ten years. We need to specify the goals before w\\ne move on to policy actions such as codenext \\nto specify how will we act on those goals. So we would want to support the plan before we go to the \\nnext process. I just want to touch on this. There's been a lot of conversations surrounding having our \\nhousing \\nstock, 75% of our housing stock within a half mile of urban centers. I do not own a car, do not \\nknow how to drive, do not talk to my mother about it. The way I look at housing is where the bus goes. It \\nis important and I'm so glad it's a big part of this p\\nlan so I definitely support that element. Overall I ask \\nyou to vote in favor of the Austin teenager housing and plan \\n-- strategic housing plan and hope you will \\nbe able to do it today. Thank you for this opportunity. \\n \",\n",

I would like for you to do a quick exercise in math \\nso don't get afraid, it's really easy. Write the number $48,000, write that number down, $48,000. And \\nthen divide that by 12. It's 4,000. The $48,00\\n0 represents the average price that a teacher gets paid \\nevery year. So if you divide that by 12, you get $12,000. Multiple that by 30%, that's $1,200. That is \\ncurrently the principal, interest, taxes and insurance would be for a etch tooer, which would be \\ngreat if \\nwe had houses that she could afford. If the teacher wanted to buy a house in Austin, that house would \\nhave to cost between 140 to 160 thousand dollars. Right now sitting where we are, apartments that cost \\nmore than that. If you look right behind u\\ns at ali downtown, 201 lavaca, one two\\n-bedroom rents for \\n1789. I can't afford that. I go further, 421 west third street, one two\\n-bedroom, 1689.

       " ' Zenobia Joseph. My handout is coming around. \\n  [3:04:10 PM]\\n  I actually\\n am in opposition to part of the plan as relates specifically to transit corridors. Transit corridors \\nare mentioned three times in the plan. The word \"Corridors\" mentioned 20 times. As a previous speaker \\nmentioned, it appears you did not plan in collaborat\\nion with capital metro transportation authority. Let \\nme just give you an example. There are two reasons why you have public transportation. One is for \\nridership, the over coverage. When you focus on ridership you are thinking bike a business, you pick the \\npeople you want to serve. When you are focus on coverage, you are thinking about the needs of the \\npeople. What I want you to recognize is much of what capital metro does is not transparent. Here\\'s a \\nspecific example. Austin community college, there is actu\\nally a stop in cedar park. For the past three \\nyears capital metro has not charged cedar park for that stop. So $27,000 was just absent from their \\nfunding stream. I often wonder why they kept the northwest feeder bus because it cost $21.23 a rider. \\nWhile cu\\ntting the routes where transit is needed in northeast and northwest Austin. The routes that I\\'m \\nspecifically talking about are where you have affordable housing. Route 383 lake line bus and the route \\n392 off breaker line. One of the things that\\'s problemat\\nic they think like a business. Route 214, they will \\nreceive money as relates to taxes from Lago vista voters. They will receive money from jonestown. I \\n\\nhave no idea how much jonestown will owe them. My point is they are focused on white people who \\nare spec\\nifically millennials, and I gave you that information on March 22, 2017, 72% white women ages \\n25 to 35 who earn over $100,000. \\n  [3:06:20 PM]\\n  While you are talking about affordable housing anchor doors, you have to recognize that the people that \\nthey focu\\ns on are not the people who need transit the most. I gave you some specific examples and I \\ngave those to councilmember Ora Houston\\'s office on April 24th, 2017. One of the things that\\'s \\nproblematic is what you are voting on a is an abstract map. That\\'s a 3\\n0,000\\n-foot view. It\\'s not on the \\nscreen, it\\'s in front of me though. You can remove the map. It\\'s meaningless. These are the corridors, \\nbut they don\\'t mean anything to the people looking at this plan. Yet this is what you are voting for. You \\ncan remove it.\\n One of the other recommendations that I have is what another person mentioned is aid. \\n [Buzzer sounding] In large part you have to recognize what the students need, what the district needs \\nand what the community needs as a whole and not vote on a plan tha\\nt was done in abstract.

To be clear this document is one \\nof a very, very few that directly addresses in needs of the most vulnerable. Transportation and \\nafford\\nability.

I have heard criticism that it is not a plan because it lays out 60 plus strategies or methods \\nfor addressing affordability. It is a plan becau\\nse fundamentally we need them all. There is no silver bullet \\nto our crisis. If there were, we wouldn't need this document frankly. We were confronted bye the \\nbeauty and strength of our city and intense market pressures and a state not sympathetic to munici\\npal \\npolicies.

So I really\\n encourage you to adopt the strategic housing \\nplan that is before you and make an amendment to the imagine Austin comprehensive plan because I \\n\\nfeel like this is a really important guiding document and will help us get us where we want to be as a \\ncity.

I'm very afraid that by not taking the time to look at what is occurring in this plan, we will \\nincrease the amount of displacement for people who have been displaced already, those who\\n are still \\nhanging on by their fingernails will be displaced. I have asked for documentation where the increase in \\nhousing stock in fact reduces the affordability. It hasn't happened in Seattle, it hasn't happened in poll, \\nnor has \\n-- Portland nor Denver. W\\ne keep following the same path and I think there's an old song that \\nsays insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. I'm afraid what's \\nwhat we're doing with the passage of this plan. We have nothing in place to protect t\\nhe people who are \\nalready here, who will be further displaced when we start building density and on the corridors. As \\nmany of you know, there's one developer that's bought up 90 properties on unwith of my corridors, one \\n\\nof my neighborhood corridors, and th\\nat whole transformation is going to happen because the people \\nwho live there don't have the capital, he this don't have the financing. It \\n-- I'm not sure that we \\nunderstand all the nuances when we talk about making Austin a compact, dense society. The peop\\nle \\nwho used to afford to live here can't like the school teacher.

I feel like \\nI\\'ve been made out to be a sprawl agent or \\nsprawl merchant. \\n  [3:36:02 PM]\\n  That was not my intent. And, you know, hearing the people in this room who I really respect and not to \\ncall her out, but Mandy Demayo, I don\\'t ever want to be on the arguing side of Mandy. And housing is \\none of those complicated sort of unverses into itsel\\nf. But my basic intent is simply to point out that what \\nwe\\'re trying to do with this plan, and it\\'s an admirable plan, is reverse really big market forces. I would \\nlove to see that happen. I would love to see the city of Austin retake that market share. In\\n this case \\nmarket share is population. But I\\'m just not sure that we have the tools. I want to be a believer that we \\n\\ncan create market rate housing, that we can generate that in the right part of town. But I\\'m just not sure \\nhow we do that. One reason why I\\n don\\'t understand that is I\\'m not a housing person. The part that I \\nknow a little bit about are big, broad population trends. And what we\\'re talking about is really stepping \\nin and taking this fabulous city of ours and really moving it, not just nudging it\\n or taking advantage of \\nopportunities where we see them, but I\\'m just worried that we\\'re fighting windmills. That we\\'re going to \\n\\nput ourselves in a position that\\'s overly aspirational. To me the word \"Strategic\" I harrisonly immaterial \\nplease achievable go\\nals. If we set goals, it\\'s a goal, it\\'s really ambitious and that grates, and we should \\nhave ambitious goals, but we need to be cognizant of when we become pollyannaish and when we\\'re \\nsetting something within the realm. I think there are things we can do. \\nMy intent is to not under mine \\nthis plan. I think it\\'s a great plan. The team, it\\'s a great team.

The one quick followup, the reason I fear overhe had asking units, \\n-- overscheduling \\nunits, somebody said it earlier, you \\nhave to have a state of oversupply. The market is probably not going \\nto let that state of oversupply ever happen. The development community, at least on the multi\\n-family \\nside, they are so sensitive to occupancy. That when citywide occupancy kicks down one \\npoint, two \\npoints, they throw the brakes on big time. As long as we\\'re all sort of on board that\\'s what we\\'re up \\nagainst, that was my intent of the memo. And it hurts to be thought of as sort of someone who is \\npromoting sprawl, that\\'s not what I want to do\\n. I want to see this city be, you know, the extremely \\nsuccessful place that we are. But our housing is expensive because we are successful. We have been the \\n\\nmost vibrant metropolitan economy in the country for six years running. So it\\'s a cookie cutter. Ou\\nr city \\nboundary is a cookie cutter you are putting on this expanding piece of dough \\n-- I don\\'t know if that \\nanalogy works.

Of organs and human beings in the systems of care in St. Davids, and \\nunderserved safety net and community as I thi\\nnk about the things that I work on in the Austin health \\ncare council. And coincidentally, when I think about the most important things to accelerate progress at \\nall three of the levels, it's digital health. \\n  [4:17:39 PM]\\n  It's the opportunity to computati\\nonally model different entities, different organ systems, whatnot.

As a point of comparison, I looked it up this morning. \\nThat's the equivalent of the gdp of New Zealand. This is who we're going to give a tax break to? Now the \\n\\ninnov\\nation zone at the Dell medical school sounds like a lovely idea and I think that good things can \\ncome of it. But I also think that when the market cap of $171 billion, Merck can pay for it themselves. \\n\\nThink about the homeowners, think about the person tryi\\nng to start a business in their \\n-- in their living \\nroom. Think about the person selling stuff on E tsy, why should that person barely making ends meet \\nhave to subsidize the development that's going to happen either way with a company that's going to \\nmake \\n-- that is currently worth $171 billion?

I think \\nI know the way this is going. But at the same time, I don't think this is a good use of public resources. \\nAnd if we are going to go ahead and pass this deal, I really don't want to hear anyone on this counc\\nil ever again complain that we may be looking at a budget cut for something in the future.

Since that time, \\nwe've developed nationally recognized out of school pr\\nograms such as girls start after school and \\nsummer camp for the year\\n-round programs for girls. The chief commitment is to provide support and \\npreserve girls in central Texas but you may wish to be aware we're reply kalting across Texas and \\nnationally. We'r\\ne able to sustain and scale our work because people view what we do as central to their \\ninterest and nurture and diverse and rich work voice. We're grateful for a dedicated group of individuals, \\nfoundations, and government entities like nasa, it's corporat\\nions who understand the role the most. It's \\ncompanies like Merck that place diversity among the core values that particularly exciting for us at girl \\nstart. 100% of girls are underserved in S.T.E.M. 80% plus of girl start after schoolgirls come from a \\nnonw\\nhite or low socioeconomic house hold. And for us hearing the core value diversity Merck has \\nclearly made is very exciting for us. S.T.E.M. Careers provide a huge opportunity not just for girls but for \\ngirls and future families since 60% of U.S. House holds\\n have a woman as sole or co\\n-breadwinner. We \\nhave the opportunity to meet with the associate vice president and mark Sylvester of Merck recently. \\n\\nAnd we were very excited. It's evident to us that they have a strong commitment to the same goals that \\nwe share\\n. I think it's worth noting that they have an ambitious yet achievable set of goals for diversity. \\n  [4:23:47 PM]\\n  Seeking to have 50% of your S.T.E.M. Workforce be female is really notable. What we've also noticed \\nfrom our own research is that's achievable with regard to Merck with their innovation hubs and \\nworkforce generally, they have accomplished a great deal of d\\niversity particularly with regard to women \\nnot just in marketing, hr, or but in true S.T.E.M. Jobs. We're excited because if Merck will come to \\nAustin, girl start girls will have a great option when considering what to study and where to work, and \\nperceive\\n Austin as a place to stay rather than leave after secondary or college. We know girls have great \\nideas and helping people is a huge inspiration to many of them. Biotech, innovative health \\n\\nadvancements fit squarely in that area. We know there are many reas\\nons why Merck opening an \\ninnovation hub in the here and now with regard to the support that you heard for the medical \\ncommunity, the medical school, and health generally.

We talked about my dad's story last week and \\none of my cry baby moments and I'll try not to repeat that today. But my biggest concern is the type of \\njobs that this company is bringing. For me, the priori\\nty is jobs \\n-- is as many jobs as possible that help our \\nlow and middle income families. And I don't see this in this package. So it's hard for me to support it. I \\nlook at the other side, which is the health side, the community benefits, yet, they are not r\\nequired to \\nprovide any of those. Yes, they've provided it in other places that they've been, but they are not \\nrequired to provide any of those.

I want to tell the rest of the story because he's not just a ged \\nrecipient. He became a firefighter and that job allowed him to continue \\n-- to continue the education. He \\nstarted taking classes. He had to take remedial high school classes to get \\nto community college. He \\n\\ntransferred. Then he got his college degree two weeks before I graduated from high school. That job, a \\n\\nged recipient, allowed my family to have the successes that it did. I think there are wonderful things in \\nthis package. I cannot\\n support it because for me a priority is bringing jobs to this city that help our \\nmiddle class and low income families. There are other companies here that do not need any incentives \\n\\nto do all of the wonderful things that Merck is promising to do. One that\\n comes off of the top of my \\nhead is HEB. They do so much for our community and, in fact, we've tried to give them incentives to \\nbuild grocery stores and they're like we don't want your incentives and they say we're going to do more \\nfor you because we know \\nyour issues.

However, I also am not going to be able to support it today. \\n  [4:2\\n9:55 PM]\\n  It's been a difficult decision for me.

For me, this dias and the rest of the community knows, I'm a constant advocate for lower \\nproperty taxes and making Austin more af\\nfordable and taking every action that we can to reduce the \\ncost of living in Austin.

So I \\n-- if it wasn't for that, I would \\nwholeheartedly endorse, you know, your move to Austin and I just want to say that I will continue to \\nwork with the chamber on wha\\nt we can do to make it easier to do business in Austin so that the small, \\nmedium, and large businesses can continue to grow.

Sexual assault is a problem and a danger every single day in our community, \\nbut we take this month in particular to highlight the stories and experiences of \\nsurvivors and to \\nemphasize the need for accountability, prevention and survivor centered response to sexual assault. The \\nsard, the sexual assault response and resource team, is a multidisciplinary coordinated community \\nresponse team for Austin and Travis c\\nounty.

And whereas the city of Austin is \\ncommitted to the belief that the body autonomy of each individual should be respected and that \\neveryone has the right to be free from violence and fear. \\nAnd whereas it is on all of us as a community \\nto address sexual violence by promoting survivor centered interventions, fostering healthy relationships, \\naddressing inequity and ensuring that justice serves to heal the community and prevent future violence. \\n  [6:16:33 PM]\\n  And whereas all austinites are invited to join the Austin two\\n-step campaign.

There's one item connected to this proclamation for autism month that I \\nam particularly proud of because I was approached actually before I was even sworn in on my\\n first term, \\nI was approached by a parent, Jackie benestante, and she told me how the city did not cover health \\ncoverage that was therapy that greatly helped children with autism and they said the city should be \\nproviding that for their employees.

So I'm proud to read this proclamation, be it known that whereas the autism \\nsociety of Texas has provided meaningful assistance to thousands of individuals with autism for 27 \\nyears. Ones of families \\n-- hundreds of familie\\ns have received support in the form of advocacy, \\nrecreation, activities and support groups and whereas the autism society of Texas spreads awareness \\nabout autism.

So it was article big deal. We're really grateful \\nfor y\\nou all to help us with that. And I know that families here are being served really well. I also want to \\nsay thank you, we received a city of Austin grant for the first time last year, and it was \\n-- we call it access \\nAustin. It's the first ever adult employ\\nment grant for adults with autism and we were able to hire an \\nemployment specialist Zach with this grant last year so we're working with adults with autism who have \\n\\nan 80% unemployment rate. So if you can imagine, there's over 300,000 individuals with auti\\nsm living in \\nTexas. There are thousands right here in the city that are living at home unable to find work and \\nsustainable living. So this grant is allowing us to engage with adults, help them work on employment \\nskills, live skills, soft skills and even do\\ning some volunteering. So we want folks to know that individuals \\nwith autism have a lot to give and have a lot to do with the city of Austin and want to give back and be \\nvibrant city members.

This is \\na common point of confusion and I think it's worth clarifying in this section where we're talking about \\noccupancy limits that \\nit only applies to new construction after 2014. It does not apply to existing \\nconstruction, existing houses that are on the ground. And really to me the line about the occupancy \\nchange could raise the cost of housing from related roommates. Of that certain\\nly could happen. There's \\nalso \\n-- and we heard lots of testimony about this when we were debating occupancy limits. Having an \\noccupancy limit could also discourage the demolition and replacement of existing housing with newer, \\ncostlier alternatives. So it s\\neems to me more in balance that either of those things is possible. And \\nindeed in areas where they were seeing lots of demolition and construction of what are termed, you \\nknow, in common parlance, stealth dorms, I think during the process they changed that\\n to high \\noccupancy housing. \\n  [6:49:59 PM]\\n  But when you \\n-- we had neighbors coming forward and others offering real specific information about \\nhow that had changed the rental rates in those places, they were not being replaced where there was \\ndemolition a\\nnd the construction of those newer housing, there was a substantial increase in costs to the \\ntenants who occupied the newer construction. So that's that edit. And again, the line that I think we \\ntalked about on Tuesday, the city should continue to monitor \\nwhether and how occupancy limits have \\nimpacted new construction. And then it seemed to me clearer, rather than saying it could have an \\nimpact, but on the other hand it shouldn't because we have \\n-- we would make \\n-- we are required to \\nmake reasonable accommo\\ndations.
